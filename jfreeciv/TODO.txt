- check if there is a race possibility in outstream when sending few packets at once
- make keys etc configurable from file
? gray out hp display if unit itself is grayed
- change ResearchDialog.GoalDialog to InternalFrame to get uniform
	l&f
- b appears on name city dialog - it is not consumed ??
- implement modes for minimap
	a) normal
	b) terrain types + cities?
	c) units+cities one color for player (with only land/ocean difference)
- do not create new unit every time, only update, as with cities
? make sound system use soft references and/or link unit instances to sounds ??
? add red glass for attack movement
- not-so-small map in window ?
- change LoginPanel to use internal frame -but how to make it modal ?
- some way to move map with mouse without deactivating unit (for goto)
- add Goto tag over destination point for units on goto ?
- added progress dialog to icon scale; wait till images load on scale
- make settings persistent - sizes of dialogs, interface options, etc
- make keybindings settable either online or in file
- correct UnitStack display - reintroduce ScrollPane ?


What still needs to be done? [bduff, April 2000]
----------------------------

o Dialogs

Most of the dialogs in freeciv haven't been implemented, or need looking
at:
  - City Screen
  - Worklists
  - Message Window
  - Advances
  - Numerous others that I don't have a clear idea of yet.

o UI

In general there are some UI improvements we'd like to see in freeciv4j.


    - textured dialog backgrounds would be quite nice and would give
things more of a "civ2" feel.

    - .. other stuff to follow

o Networking

Packets involved past the very start of the game still need to be
tested.

Handlers need to be written for a large number of incoming packets that
can be received after the game has been launched on the server.

o Infrastructure

The interface to Client.java needs to be properly pinned down. At the
moment, lots of stuff is exposed that shouldn't be, and there are
screeds of redundant code.

Need to write some documentation on the internals.

Need to set up a web site.

Need to branch the CVS code so that other people can access this code;
also need to provide access to old (1.8) stable code from the web site,
ideally with a compiled version.

o I18n

I may have un-internationalized some stuff while I've been working; need
to go through and check that strings are properly _()ed.

o Other stuff

I'm sure there's a huge amount of other stuff to be done; I'll add it as
I think of it.
