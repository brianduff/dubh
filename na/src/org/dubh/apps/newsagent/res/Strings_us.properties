# NewsAgent v0.1 Strings Resource
# (C) 1997-8 Brian Duff.
# This is the US English string bundle- only need to define strings
# that are different from UK English.
# Users shouldn't need to edit this file: create a new one with your
# locale encoding, and it will work... (e.g. Strings_fr.properties for
# french).
