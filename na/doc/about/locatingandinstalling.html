<!-- THE INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS ARE BADLY OUT OF DATE
      I've not decided how 1.1.0 is going to be bundled yet. Information needs to go in
      here about upgrading existing installations (1.0.2 upwards should be upgradable,
      just requiring an update to dju, na and the newsagent.exe file, plus any additional
      JAR dependencies (javamail and activation in 1.1.0).
      swingall.jar no longer needs to be included in any distrib for 1.1.0 because it's in
      Java 1.2.

NewsAgent System Requirements<A NAME="2"></A></H2>
NewsAgent requires a platform which can run Java 1.2 (or later) applications.
You cannot use NewsAgent with any earlier version of Java. JavaSoft provide

<CENTER>
<P>NewsAgent has been tested under Win32 platforms, and Linux.
<P><B><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">YOU MUST HAVE JAVA INSTALLED TO USE NEWSAGENT</FONT></B>
<P>due to its size, Java is <I>not</I> distributed with NewsAgent, but
is freely available from Sun Microsystems.</CENTER>

<P>Java can be quite slow on low performance systems. You should consider
a minimum memory requirement of 16Mb.
<P>NewsAgent needs ??Mb of disk space once installed. This is on top of
the space required by the JRE.

Installing NewsAgent on Microsoft Windows<A NAME="3"></A></H2>
This section explains how to install NewsAgent on Microsoft Windows(TM)
95, 98, NT4 or 2000. If you already have an older version of NewsAgent
(1.0.2 or above), see the instructions for upgrading below.
<P>To install NewsAgent from scratch on Windows:
<UL>
<LI>
Go to the&nbsp;<A HREF="http://st-and.compsoc.org.uk/~briand/newsagent/userdoc/advanced/writingagents.html"><IMG SRC="hlpWebSite.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=16 WIDTH=16></A><A HREF="http://st-and.compsoc.org.uk/%7Ebriand/newsagent/download.html" target="_top">downloads</A>
section on the&nbsp;<A HREF="http://st-and.compsoc.org.uk/~briand/newsagent/userdoc/advanced/writingagents.html"><IMG SRC="hlpWebSite.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=16 WIDTH=16></A><A HREF="http://st-and.compsoc.org.uk/%7Ebriand/newsagent" target="_top">NewsAgent
Web Site</A>. Read the license agreement and select the Win32 installer
download. This will download a .zip file onto your machine.</LI>

<LI>
Unzip the ZIP file into a temporary directory. You will need an application
such as&nbsp;<A HREF="http://st-and.compsoc.org.uk/~briand/newsagent/userdoc/advanced/writingagents.html"><IMG SRC="hlpWebSite.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=16 WIDTH=16></A><A HREF="http://www.winzip.com" target="_top">WinZIP</A>
to do this. PKUNZIP may not work correctly, since the ZIP file contains
long filenames.</LI>

<LI>
Run the setup.exe program. This program will check to see whether you have
up to date versions of the JRE installed. You must have the JRE installed
to proceed with setup.</LI>

<LI>
The setup program will prompt you for an installation directory. Choose
any directory you like.</LI>

<LI>
NewsAgent is now installed on your computer. You can delete the distribution
ZIP file and any temporary files. If you ever want to uninstall NewsAgent,
use the Add/Remove Programs... Control Panel. You can run NewsAgent from
the Start Menu or by double clicking newsagent.exe in the installation
directory.</LI>
</UL>

<H2>
Installing NewsAgent on UNIX (e.g. Linux, Solaris)<A NAME="4"></A></H2>
This section explains how to install NewsAgent on UNIX platforms. We assume
you have already installed JRE 1.2 and that the java\bin directory is in
your PATH environment variable.
<UL>
<LI>
Go to the&nbsp;<A HREF="http://st-and.compsoc.org.uk/~briand/newsagent/userdoc/advanced/writingagents.html"><IMG SRC="hlpWebSite.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=16 WIDTH=16></A><A HREF="http://st-and.compsoc.org.uk/%7Ebriand/newsagent/download.html" target="_top">downloads</A>

Web Site</A>. Read the license agreement and select the combined 1.1.0
jar file download. The distribution will be contained in a zipped archive
file (you will need unzip or a similar utility to decompress this file).</LI>

<BR>Change to the directory in which you want to install newsagent (e.g.
/local/packages/newsagent) and unpack the archive file. This will create
three JAR files, the license agreement and a readme file. It will also
create a shell script called newsagent that contains a command for launching
java with the NewsAgent classes.
<LI>
Change into the directory you installed NewsAgent in and type ./newsagent</LI>

<LI>
You may now delete the zip file</LI>
</UL>
If the newsagent script file fails to launch NewsAgent, check the following:
<UL>
<LI>
All JAR files are in the installation directory and haven't changed their
names.</LI>

<LI>
You have the correct version of Java installed and in your path. You can
check this by typing "java -version".</LI>

<LI>
You are running under an XWindows session, or have your DISPLAY environment
variable set to a machine with an XServer.</LI>

<LI>
/bin/sh is a valid shell.</LI>

Upgrading from NewsAgent 1.0.2<A NAME="7"></A></H2>
Since NewsAgent 1.0.2, it has been possible to upgrade an existing installation.
To do this, you just need to download the altered JAR files and replace
the old ones from the NewsAgent directory. Windows users can also download
an upgraded newsagent.exe program (plus a .reg file for updating the registry).
<P>Go to the downloads page, and follow the upgrades link for more information.
You should take note of the dependencies for each version.
