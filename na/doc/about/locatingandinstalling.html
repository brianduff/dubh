<h2>NewsAgent System Requirements<a name="2"></a></h2>
<p>NewsAgent requires a platform which can run Java 1.1.5 (or later) applications. 
  NewsAgent can run under some earlier versions of Java, but there are some problems. 
  You cannot use NewsAgent with Java 1.0. JavaSoft provide a <a href="http://st-and.compsoc.org.uk/~briand/newsagent/userdoc/advanced/writingagents.html"><img src="../images/hlpWebSite.gif" width="16" height="16" border="0"></a><a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.1/jre/index.html" target="_top">Java 
  Runtime Environment</a> for Microsoft Windows and Solaris UNIX platforms. Runtime

<p align="CENTER"><b><font color="#FF0000">YOU MUST HAVE JAVA INSTALLED TO USE 
  NEWSAGENT</font></b></p>
<p align="CENTER">due to its size, Java is <i>not</i> distributed with NewsAgent, 
  but is freely available from Sun Microsystems.</p>
<p>Java can be quite slow on low performance systems. You should consider a minimum 
  memory requirement of 16Mb.</p>
<p>NewsAgent needs ??Mb of disk space once installed. In addition, the Java Runtime 
  environment included in the Windows and Solaris distributions take ??Mb and 
  ??Mb respectively.</p>

<h2>Installing NewsAgent on Microsoft Windows<a name="3"></a></h2>
<p>This section explains how to install NewsAgent on Microsoft Windows(TM). Follow 
  these instructions:</p>

  <li>Go to the <a href="http://st-and.compsoc.org.uk/~briand/newsagent/userdoc/advanced/writingagents.html"><img src="../images/hlpWebSite.gif" width="16" height="16" border="0"></a><a href="http://st-and.compsoc.org.uk/%7Ebriand/newsagent/download.html" target="_top">downloads</a>

    Web Site</a>. Use the download wizard to determine which download is correct 
    for you. This will depend on whether you already have the Swing toolkit installed 
    on your computer.</li>
  <li>Unzip the ZIP file into a temporary directory. You will need an application 
    such as <a href="http://st-and.compsoc.org.uk/~briand/newsagent/userdoc/advanced/writingagents.html"><img src="../images/hlpWebSite.gif" width="16" height="16" border="0"></a><a href="http://www.winzip.com" target="_top">WinZIP</a> 
    to do this. PKUNZIP may not work correctly, since the ZIP file contains long 
    filenames.</li>
  <li>Run the setup.exe program. This program will check to see whether you have 
    up to date versions of the JDK or JRE installed. You must have the JDK or 
    JRE installed to proceed with setup. If you have downloaded the distribution 
    of NewsAgent which <i>doesn't </i> contain Swing, you must tell the setup 
    program where the swingall.jar file is located on your computer.</li>
  <li>The setup program will prompt you for an installation directory. Choose 
    any directory you like.</li>
  <li>NewsAgent is now installed on your computer. You can delete the distribution 
    ZIP file and any temporary files. If you ever want to uninstall NewsAgent, 
    use the Add/Remove Programs... Control Panel. You can run NewsAgent from the 
    Start Menu or by double clicking newsagent.exe in the installation directory.</li>

<h2>Installing NewsAgent on Solaris (UNIX)<a name="4"></a></h2>
<p>This section explains how to install NewsAgent on Solaris UNIX platforms. Follow 
  these instructions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Go to the <a href="http://st-and.compsoc.org.uk/~briand/newsagent/userdoc/advanced/writingagents.html"><img src="../images/hlpWebSite.gif" width="16" height="16" border="0"></a><a href="http://st-and.compsoc.org.uk/%7Ebriand/newsagent/download.html" target="_top">downloads</a>

    Web Site</a>. Use the download wizard to determine which download is correct 
    for you. This will depend on whether you already have the Swing toolkit installed 
    on your computer. The distribution will be contained in a tarred and gzipped 
    archive file.</li>
  <li>Change to the directory in which you want to install newsagent (e.g. /local/packages/) 
    and unpack the archive file with the commands:<br>
    <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">gunzip naunix-102.tgz<br>
    tar -xvf naunix-102.tar</font> <br>
  </li>
  <li>NewsAgent is now installed on your computer. You may want to add the directory 
    <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">/local/packages/newsagent</font> to 
    your PATH environment variable to make it easier to run NewsAgent. To do this, 
    edit your .tcshrc or .cshrc file and add the following line to the end:<br>
    <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">setenv PATH $PATH:/local/packages/newsagent/bin 
    </font><br>
  </li>
  <li>You may now delete the tar file (newsagent-solaris.tar).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Installing NewsAgent on MacOS (System 8)<a name="5"></a></h2>
<p>NewsAgent has not been tested on the Macintosh at present. If you have any 
  success installing it, please contact me at <a href="http://st-and.compsoc.org.uk/~briand/newsagent/userdoc/advanced/writingagents.html"><img src="../images/hlpWebSite.gif" width="16" height="16" border="0"></a><a href="mailto:bd@dcs.st-andrews.ac.uk" target="">bd@dcs.st-andrews.ac.uk</a>.

<h2>Installing NewsAgent on Other Platforms<a name="6"></a></h2>
<p>NewsAgent will work on any platform which has a Java Runtime environment version 
  1.1.5 or later. More information on <a href="http://st-and.compsoc.org.uk/~briand/newsagent/userdoc/advanced/writingagents.html"><img src="../images/hlpWebSite.gif" width="16" height="16" border="0"></a><a href="http://java.sun.com/cgi-bin/java-ports.cgi" target="_top">third

</p>
<ul>
  <li>Download and install the JRE or JDK 1.1.5 (or later) on your computer.</li>
  <li>Use the download wizard on the NewsAgent web page, telling it about your 
    system. If your system is not Windows 32 bit or Macintosh, you will be able 
    to download the crossplatform version. It will be compressed using ZIP.</li>
  <li>Unarchive the crossplatfrom distribution archive into a common directory 
    (for instance /local/packages/newsagent on UNIX systems).</li>
  <li>Add the following items to your CLASSPATH environment variable or equivalent. 
    Replace /local/packages with the directory your installed newsagent into. 
    <ul>
      <li>/local/packages/newsagent/swingall.jar</li>
      <li>/local/packages/newsagent/newsagent.jar</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Run NewsAgent using the command<br>
