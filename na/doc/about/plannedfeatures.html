<h1>Future Plans for NewsAgent</h1>
<h2>Plans for the Next Version (1.03)<a name="1.03"></a></h2>
<p>I'm about to start a new job with <a href="http://st-and.compsoc.org.uk/~briand/newsagent/userdoc/advanced/writingagents.html"><img src="../images/hlpWebSite.gif" width="16" height="16" border="0"></a><a href="http://www.oracle.co.uk" target="_top">Oracle 
  UK</a>, and will be moving to the other end of the UK and training for seven 
  weeks. Because of this, it might be a while before I have enough free time to 
  work on the next version of NewsAgent. I'll estimate the next release date as 
  being sometime in September or October 1998... When I do have time, these are 
  the features I will be working on:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Support for mime types, HTML encoded messages.</li>
  <li>Email support, both outgoing and incoming (POP3). Please drop me a line 
    (at <a href="http://st-and.compsoc.org.uk/~briand/newsagent/userdoc/advanced/writingagents.html"><img src="../images/hlpWebSite.gif" width="16" height="16" border="0"></a><a href="mailto:bd@dcs.st-and.ac.uk">bd@dcs.st-and.ac.uk</a>) 
    and let me know if it would be better to release a separate application for 
    email, or if an integrated newsreader and email reader would be preferrable.</li>
  <li><i>Big</i> improvements to the networking code. It's the oldest and most 
    shaky part of NewsAgent, and was written when I didn't know much about Java. 
    As a result, it's really messy and pretty buggy. Somewhat connected with this 
    is the caching code (part of the StorageManager in NewsAgent). Message bodies 
    are not cached at all, and there are numerous problems with header caching 
    too (speed being amongst the most prominent). If I change these portions of 
    NewsAgent drastically, I'll make the next version a major release (NewsAgent 
    2.0). </li>
  <li>Improvements to the subscriptions dialogue. It's a bit messy just now, and 
    difficult to find specific newsgroups. An improved version should have been 
    part of version 1.02, but I was still bug fixing the code at the release date. 
    I'll keep working on it and incorporate the changes into 1.03.</li>
  <li>More agents</li>
  <li>Better agent integration: facilities for agents to add context menu items 
    and toolbar icons etc.</li>
  <li>Improvements to the relevance agent. It's riddled with bugs. The most severe 
    is the fact that it loses all your scoring and action conditions when you 
    quit NewsAgent. The code was hastily written in a few days before my SH Project 
    deadline, and released undocumented in version 1.01. Version 1.02 has documentation 
    for the agent, but I haven't touched the code. This will be fixed in 1.03.</li>
  <li>More internationalised dialogue boxes. About half the dialogues still use 
    hard-coded strings in UK English.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Long Term Plans (1.04 or 2.01 and beyond...)</h2>
<p>After that lot is done, I'll be fairly satisfied with NewsAgent. To stop me 
  from becoming complacent, why not suggest some features or bugs you really want 
  to see fixed by emailing me at <a href="http://st-and.compsoc.org.uk/~briand/newsagent/userdoc/advanced/writingagents.html"><img src="../images/hlpWebSite.gif" width="16" height="16" border="0"></a><a href="mailto:bd@dcs.st-and.ac.uk">bd@dcs.st-and.ac.uk</a>.</p>
