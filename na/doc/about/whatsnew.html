<h1>What's New?</h1>
<h2>Version 1.02 [08 July 1998]<a name="Version1.02"></a></h2>
<p>This version of NewsAgent contains a number of enhancements and bug fixes from 
  the previous release.</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Documentation Updates<br>
    </b>The documentation of NewsAgent hadn't been updated since before the 1.0 
    release (April 1998). It contained many inaccuracies, missing information, 
    bad links and other atrocities. Version 1.02 includes updated documentation 
    that is hopefully an improvement over the last version.</li>
  <li><b>Windows Release Improvement<br>
    </b>The Windows 32-bit release of NewsAgent has been substantially improved. 
    It now has a proper installation program, adds a Start Menu shortcut for the 
    program and can be uninstalled. Additionally, the batch file from previous 
    versions has been replaced by a proper binary .exe file (called the launcher 
    stub). This binary file checks for the location of Java on your system and 
    runs Java with the correct CLASSPATH and arguments to start NewsAgent. This 
    should help prevent the fiddly installation problems that many people complained 
    about in the previous releases.</li>
  <li><b>Help System Inside NewsAgent<br>
    </b>The <a href="http://st-and.compsoc.org.uk/~briand/newsagent/userdoc/advanced/writingagents.html"><img src="../images/hlpWebSite.gif" width="16" height="16" border="0"></a><a href="http://st-and.compsoc.org.uk/%7Ebriand/newsagent/userdoc/menus/helpmenu.html#HelpHelpContents" class="menucommand" target="_top">Help:Contents</a> 
    menu item actually works now, and brings up a browser window. NewsAgent can 
    also be configured to use your favourite web browser instead of its own internal 
    browser (which is rather crap).</li>
  <li><b>Splash Screen</b><br>
    This was added to help placate users during the lengthy startup that has to 
    be endured before the NewsAgent main window appears.</li>
  <li><b>Signatures [TBD]<br>
    </b>Although some of the dialogues for adding signatures to outgoing messages 
    have been present since the first release of NewsAgent, it has never been 
    properly implemented. You can now automatically insert signatures into outgoing 
    messages, or maintain a number of signatures for outgoing messages and decide 
    which one to use from the composition window. Signatures are now implemented 
    as a Send Agent, so the signature configuration has moved from the &quot;Send&quot; 
    tab of the options dialogue to the Signature Agent Configuration in the &quot;Send 
    Agents&quot; tab.</li>
  <li><b>Send Agents<br>
    </b>Send Agents were unimplemented in the previous release of NewsAgent. They 
    are now fully supported.</li>
  <li><b>Debugging </b><br>
    In case anyone out there is actually beta testing NewsAgent (I've had hardly 
    any bug reports, which is highly suspicious given the dodgy nature of the 
    program and the large number of people who have downloaded it), this will 
    be a useful feature. Because the new Win32 startup program no longer launches 
    from a DOS (or Command) Prompt, debug messages have nowhere to go. A debugging 
    console window has been added, which you can enable by specifying the <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">-console</font> 
    command line option. To actually switch debugging on, you need to use the 
    <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">-debug</font> command line option 
    (introduced in 1.01). A new additional flag (<font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">-debugnet</font>) 
    is supported that echoes all TCP socket traffic between NewsAgent and your 
    NNTP servers.
  <li><b>Message Composer Improvements</b><br>
    The <a href="http://st-and.compsoc.org.uk/~briand/newsagent/userdoc/advanced/writingagents.html"><img src="../images/hlpWebSite.gif" width="16" height="16" border="0"></a><a href="http://st-and.compsoc.org.uk/%7Ebriand/newsagent/userdoc/dialogs/messagecomposer.html" target="_top">Message 
    Composer dialogue</a> has been improved in a few ways. You can save the contents 
    of the editor and load or insert text files. When replying to a message, you 
    can choose to quote all of the message, or just a selected portion. You can 
    customise the text that quoted messages begin with, and the text that is prepended 
    to each quoted line. The editor now wraps properly and can't be resized horizontally 
    greater than 80 characters (this needs Swing 1.0.2). There are options to 
    send messages with hard line breaks after each line of 80 characters, or to 
    send each paragraph on a single line. <br>
    You can now add some common NNTP message headers to your compositions (Reply-To, 
    Followup-To etc.), and also add any customised headers you want to the composition 
    dialogue. There is also support for file carbon copy (Fcc).<br>
    A few bugs have been fixed too: if something goes wrong when you try to send 
    the message, the message composition dialogue no longer disappears (taking 
    your beloved composition with it). The message composer will no longer let 
    you send a message with no subject.
</ul>

<h2>Version 1.01 [19 May 1998]<a name="Version1.01"></a></h2>
<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>Removed reliance on NNTP DATE command<br>
    </b>The previous version of NewsAgent relied on your NNTP Server having the 
    DATE command. This command is used on some servers, but is not part of the 
    NNTP RFC specification. Subsequently, many users reported problems when downloading 
    the list of newsgroups from their news server.<br>
    The DATE command is now only used if the News Server supports it. Otherwise, 
    the client's system date is used.</li>
  <li><b>Fixed NumberFormatException bug in the Add Server... dialogue</b><br>
    If you failed to specify a port in the<a href="http://st-and.compsoc.org.uk/~briand/newsagent/userdoc/dialogs/addeditserverprops.html"> 
    </a><a href="http://st-and.compsoc.org.uk/~briand/newsagent/userdoc/advanced/writingagents.html"><img src="../images/hlpWebSite.gif" width="16" height="16" border="0"></a><a href="http://st-and.compsoc.org.uk/%7Ebriand/newsagent/userdoc/dialogs/addeditserverprops.html" target="_top">Add 
    Server.. dialogue</a>, NewsAgent displayed an error message and threw an exception. 
    This has now been fixed. Additionally, the Port: input box now displays 119 
    by default and is wider than one character.</li>
  <li><b>Fixed column header bug in message thread panel</b><br>
    The message thread panel's column header was badly implemented in the previous 
    version, and didn't scroll horizontally when the rest of the panel was scrolled. 
    This has now been fixed.</li>
  <li><b>Made OK / Cancel buttons consistent<br>
    </b>The order of OK and Cancel buttons in dialogue boxes was inconsistent 
    in the last version. OK is now always to the left of Cancel in dialogue boxes.</li>
  <li><b>Fixed scrollbar update bug in Subscriptions dialogue</b><br>
    The scrollbar on the newsgroup list in the Subscriptions dialogue didn't update 
    properly when the contents of the list were changed. This has now been fixed.</li>
  <li><b>Fixed message display panel clearing</b><br>
    The message display panel should be cleared when a message is not selected. 
    In the previous version, it continued to contain text even when a different 
    server (or nothing at all) was selected in the folders & servers tree panel. 
    Now it is cleared on all selection events, unless a message has been selected.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Added Features</h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>List Agents</b><br>
    List Agents are now properly supported. These are &quot;plugin&quot; code 
    modules that affect the way message headers are displayed depending on the 
    contents of the headers. More information is available in <a href="http://st-and.compsoc.org.uk/%7Ebriand/newsagent/userdoc/advanced/writingagents.html" target="_top"><img src="../images/hlpWebSite.gif" width="16" height="16" border="0">advanced 
    topics</a> in the <a href="http://st-and.compsoc.org.uk/~briand/newsagent/userdoc/advanced/writingagents.html"><img src="../images/hlpWebSite.gif" width="16" height="16" border="0"></a><a href="http://st-and.compsoc.org.uk/%7Ebriand/newsagent/userdoc/index.html" target="_top">user 
    manual</a>.</li>
  <li><b>Debugging Support<br>
    </b>To help track down bugs and other problems in NewsAgent, debugging support 
    has been switched back on. It is enabled by specifying the -debug option on 
    the command line, or adding the newsagent.debug.DebugMessages preference to 
    your preference file (see the <a href="http://st-and.compsoc.org.uk/~briand/newsagent/userdoc/advanced/writingagents.html"><img src="../images/hlpWebSite.gif" width="16" height="16" border="0"></a><a href="http://st-and.compsoc.org.uk/%7Ebriand/newsagent/userdoc/advanced/preferences.html" target="_top">Editing 
    Preference Files</a> topic in <a href="http://st-and.compsoc.org.uk/~briand/newsagent/userdoc/advanced/writingagents.html"><img src="../images/hlpWebSite.gif" width="16" height="16" border="0"></a><a href="http://st-and.compsoc.org.uk/%7Ebriand/newsagent/userdoc/advanced/index.html" target="_top">Advanced 
    Topics</a> in the<a href="http://st-and.compsoc.org.uk/~briand/newsagent/userdoc/advanced/writingagents.html"><img src="../images/hlpWebSite.gif" width="16" height="16" border="0"></a> 
    <a href="../userdoc/index.html" target="_top">User Manual</a>). When switched 
    on, more detailed information about any errors that occur is displayed on 
    the console (sent to stderr).</li>
  <li><b>RelevanceAgent added</b><br>
    This is a List Agent that allows you to assign scoring conditions on message 
    headers. The headers are then formatted differently depending on their scores, 
    or optionally deleted.</li>
  <li><b>Unread Message Highlight Agent Added</b><br>
    This agent marks messages which haven't been read yet differently from read 
    messages. You can configure the colour, font and size of such messages, and 
    switch the automatic formatting on or off.</li>
  <li><b>Updated Swing distribution</b><br>
    The distribution including Swing now contains the latest version of Swing 
    (1.0.2). This has resulted in a minor change to the way split panes are drawn 
    in the Java look and feel. N.b. NewsAgent will still work perfectly well with 
    Swing 1.0.1.</li>
  <li><b>Edit->Copy menu item enabled</b><br>
    Edit/Copy can now be used to copy text from the currently selected message 
    into the clipboard.</li>
  <li><b>Customisable Headers in Message Display</b><br>
    The headers shown above the message body can now be customised to show any 
    number of headers in any order. The default headers have been extended from 
    just From: and Subject: to (pending). In the current version, there is no 
    user access to this customisation (sorry), but this will be added in the next 
    version.</li>
</ul>
