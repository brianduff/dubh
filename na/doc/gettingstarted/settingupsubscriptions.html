<h2>About Newsgroups<a name="aboutnewsgroups"></a></h2>
<p>News contained on Network News servers is contained in a number of special 
  interest areas, known as Newsgroups. There are many thousands of common Newsgroups, 
  and the groups which are available will vary from server to server. Whatever 
  you are interested in, there may well be a Newsgroup catering to you and others 
  around the world who have a similar interest.</p>
<p>Since there are so many Newsgroups, NewsAgent requires you to <i>subscribe</i> 
  to Newsgroups which you are interested in. Of course, you can change the groups 
  you are subscribed to at any time.</p>

<h2>Changing Subscriptions<a name="changing subscriptions"></a></h2>
<p>Before you can subscribe to Newsgroups, you must<a href="settingupnews.html"> 
  tell NewsAgent what News Server to use</a>. Next, do the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Invoke the <a href="../menus/serversmenu.html#ServersSubscriptions" target="" class="menucommand">Servers: 
    Subscriptions</a> menu command. The following <a href="../dialogs/subscriptions.html">dialogue</a> 
    will appear:</li>
</ul>
<p align="CENTER"><a href="../dialogs/subscriptions.html"><img src="../images/ServerSubscriptions_noselection.gif" width="366" height="283" alt="Server Subscriptions Dialogue" border="0"></a></p>
<ul>
  <li>Select the News Server you wish to change subscriptions for by clicking 
    over its name in the <i><a href="../dialogs/subscriptions.html#NewsServers" target="">News 
    Servers</a></i><a href="../dialogs/subscriptions.html"> list</a>. If you aren't 
    currently connected to the News Server, you will see the following message:</li>
</ul>
<p align="CENTER"><img src="../images/notonline.gif" width="404" height="136"></p>
<ul>
  <li>Press enter, or click on &quot;Yes&quot; to allow NewsAgent to open a connection 
    to your News Server.</li>
  <li>NewsAgent will display a status message, while it connects to the server 
    and downloads the list of new newsgroups. This will take slightly longer than 
    usual the first time you do it, since NewsAgent has to download the whole 
    list of groups from the server.</li>
  <li>Newsgroups will now be displayed in the central list. You can change the 
    contents of the list by clicking on one of the three radio buttons at the 
    right of the dialog:</li>
</ul>
<div align="CENTER">
  <table border="1" width="70%">
    <tr> 
      <td><i>All</i></td>
      <td>Show all the newsgroups the server provides.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr> 
      <td><i>Subscribed</i></td>
      <td>Just show newsgroups to which you have subscribed.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr> 
      <td><i>New</i></td>
      <td>Just show newsgroups which have been added to the server since the last 
        time you checked.</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>
<ul>
  <li>You can subscribe to any newsgroup by selecting it and clicking on the <i>Subscribe</i> 
    button. Conversely, you can unsubscribe by selecting and clicking on <i>Unsubscribe</i>. 
    In fact, you can select multiple newsgroups in the list to subscribe to or 
    unsubscribe from. The way in which this is done is platform dependent. Normally, 
    it involves holding down shift or some other modifier key (such as Ctrl) and 
    selecting items. </li>
  <li>Click on OK to save your subscription changes. You should now be able to 
    see your subscribed newsgroups in the tree control at the left of the main 
    NewsAgent window: 
    <blockquote>&nbsp; </blockquote>
  </li>
