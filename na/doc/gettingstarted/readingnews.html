<p>In order to read news, you will have to be familiar with the user interface 
  of NewsAgent's main window. The window contains three panels. You can adjust 
  the size of these panels at any time. The three panels are shown in the diagram 
  below.</p>

      <p>A tree containing two top level nodes (&quot;Servers&quot; and &quot;Folders&quot;). 
        Servers contains an icon for each News Server you are using. This icon

        or not. The server node contains icons for each newsgroup you are subscribed 
        to on that server.</p>
      <p>The Folders sub tree contains icons for all the folders you can save 
        and retrieve messages to and from.</p>

        Information about the message, such as who it was written by, the date 
        it was posted and the subject are displayed in columns. You can adjust 
        the width of these columns by dragging the separators between the column 
        headers.</p>

        left of any header.</p>
