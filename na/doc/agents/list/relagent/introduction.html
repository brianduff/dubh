<h2>Setting Up the Relevance Agent<a name="SettingUpTheRelevanceAgent"></a></h2> 
<p>The Relevance Agent is an agent that lets you change the appearance of message  
  headers based on how relevant you think they are. </p> 
<p>To switch on the Relevance Agent, go to the <a href="../../../dialogs/prefslistagents.html" target="">List  
  Agents Panel</a> of the Preferences Dialogue (<a href="../../../menus/editmenu.html#EditPreferences" target="" class="menucommand">Edit:Preferences</a>).  
  Locate &quot;Relevance Agent&quot; in the list of available agents, and double  
  click the list item to check the checkbox next to it. Click on the Configure...  
  button at the bottom right of the panel to configure the behaviour of the agent.</p> 
<h2>Relevance Rules<a name="RelevanceRules"></a></h2> 
<p>The Relevance Agent uses a set of relevance rules to change your message headers.  
  Each rule has a descriptive name and a set of associated newsgroups. When you  
  first click on the Configure... button to configure the Relevance Agent, you  
  will be presented with the <a href="configuration.html">Relevance Agent Configuration  
  Dialogue</a>. This dialogue has a list of all the relevance rules you have set  
  up, and the newsgroups that each one affects. You can add, remove, edit or change  
  the order of the rules from this dialogue.</p> 
<p>Each rule is composed of a list of Scoring Conditions and Action Conditions.</p> 
<h2>Scoring Conditions<a name="ScoringConditions"></a></h2> 
<p>Each Relevance Rule has an associated set of scoring conditions. Each message  
  header that passes through the agent starts with an initial score of zero. Scoring  
  conditions alter that score, depending on the contents of the header fields.  
  Some examples of scoring conditions are:</p> 
<ul> 
  <li><i>&quot;If the <b>From</b> header <b>contains</b> <b>Brian</b> then <b>subtract  
    100 from </b>its score.&quot;</i></li> 
  <li><i>&quot;If the <b>Subject</b> header <b>starts with</b> <b>Re:</b> then  
    <b>add 50 to</b> its score.&quot;</i></li> 
</ul> 
<p>As you can see, each scoring condition has four main configurable parts (in  
  bold):</p> 
<ul> 
  <li>A header field to check (e.g. From, Subject)</li> 
  <li>How to compare the header (contains, starts with, ends with or equals)</li> 
  <li>Text to compare the header with (e.g. Brian, Re:)</li> 
  <li>A value to add or subtract from its score (e.g. +100, -50)</li> 
</ul> 
<p>Scoring conditions are added to relevance rules using the Scoring Condition  
  Editor. This dialogue is displayed when you use the <a href="wiz1.html">Add  
  / Edit Relevance Rule Wizard</a>. </p> 
<h2>Action Conditions<a name="ActionConditions"></a></h2> 
<p>Once a message header has been passed through all your scoring conditions,  
  it will have a final score. The next step is to alter the message in some way  
  (perform an action) based on that score. Some examples of action conditions  
  are:</p> 
<ul> 
  <li><i>&quot;If the score is <b>less than -100</b> then <b>delete the message</b>.&quot;</i></li> 
  <li><i>&quot;If the score is <b>between -99 and 99</b> then <b>display the message  
    header in bold, red text.</b>&quot;</i></li> 
</ul> 
<p>There are two main configurable parts to action conditions:</p> 
<ul> 
  <li>A range and value(s) to compare the score to (less than x, equal to x, greater  
    than x or between x and y)</li> 
  <li>An action to take if the condition is true (delete the message or change  
    the font, size and colour of its header)</li> 
</ul> 
<p>Action conditions are added to relevance rules using the Action Condition Editor.  
  This dialogue is displayed when you use the <a href="wiz1.html">Add / Edit Relevance  
  Rule Wizard</a>.</p>
