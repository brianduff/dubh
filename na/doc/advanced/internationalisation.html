<h1>Customising NewsAgent for Internationalisation</h1> 
<h2>Internationalisation<a name="Internationalisation"></a></h2> 
<p>NewsAgent is designed to be system and language independent (with the obvious  
  exception of the user documentation). However, I am not a linguist, so the provision  
  of foreign language support with the current release of NewsAgent is somewhat  
  limited. </p> 
<p>Nevertheless, NewsAgent supports internationalisation, and it is possible for  
  the user to edit NewsAgent's string tables and convert it into another language.</p> 
<p>At the moment, some basic translations are provided, for instance Organisation  
  becomes Organization if the program is being run using Java in the US.</p> 
<div align="LEFT"> 
  <h2>Digging Into the Jar<a name="DiggingIntoTheJar"></a> </h2> 
</div> 
<p>All of NewsAgent's strings are stored in some files in the <span class="codefixed">newsagent.jar</span>  
  file distributed with NewsAgent. This file is really just a PKZip file: you  
  can decompress it with pkunzip or<a href="http://st-and.compsoc.org.uk/~briand/newsagent/userdoc/advanced/writingagents.html"><img src="../images/hlpWebSite.gif" width="16" height="16" border="0"></a><a href="http://www.winzip.com">Winzip</a>.</p> 
<p>Inside the JAR file, you will notice two files called <span class="codefixed">Strings.properties</span>  
  and <span class="codefixed">Menus.properties</span>. The Strings file contains  
  all strings used in dialogue boxes and window titles, and the Menus file contains  
  the order, layout and labels for menus.</p> 
<p>To Internationalise NewsAgent, <b>you should not edit these files directly</b>.  
  Instead, make a copy of them, renaming them to <span class="codefixed">Strings_XX.properties</span>  
  and <span class="codefixed">Menus_XX.properties</span>, where <span class="codefixed">XX</span>  
  is the two letter country code of your locale, for instance this is uk for Great  
  Britain, us for the United States, fr for France, de for Germany and so on.</p> 
<p>You can now edit these files and translate them as you wish, add them to the  
  Jar file, and NewsAgent will automatically use your translations (provided your  
  computer is set up properly for your locale). </p> 
<h2>Other Customisations<a name="OtherCustomisations"></a></h2> 
<p>As mentioned above, you can also change the order and layout of menus and toolbars  
  in NewsAgent by editing the Menus.properties file. You can even change the images  
  NewsAgent uses for its toolbars by adding or replacing files in the images subdirectory  
  of the JAR file.</p> 
<p>More information on customising the toolbar is available in the <a href="../menus/toolbar.html"><img src="../images/hlpTopic.gif" width="16" height="16" border="0">Toolbar</a>  
  topic in <a href="../menus/index.html"><img src="../images/hlpBook.gif" width="16" height="16" border="0">Menus  
  &amp; Dialogues.</a></p>
