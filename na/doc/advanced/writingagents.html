<h1>Writing Agents</h1>
<h2>About Agents<a name="AboutAgents"></a></h2>
<p>There are two types of Agent in NewsAgent. The SendAgent can modify or examine 
  message text before it is posted to a Newsgroup and the ListAgent can examine 
  message headers before they are listed in the Message Header List Panel in NewsAgent's 
  main window.</p>
<p>A number of Agents are provided with NewsAgent. Documentation for them is provided 
  here. The idea is that NewsAgent can be easily extended by the addition of more 
  agents.</p>
<p>Agents are actually classes of Java code, which have a specific interface that 
  NewsAgent can use when messages are sent or listed.</p>
<p>This topic gives a brief overview of what is required to write your own Agents. 
  More information is available on the NewsAgent Developers page at:</p>

  <h2>Before You Begin<a name="BeforeYouBegin"></a> </h2>
</div>
<p>There are a number of requirements before you can write your own Agents. You 
  will have to make sure your computer is configured so that:</p>
<ul>
  <li>JDK 1.1.5 or above is installed on your system. You <i>must</i> have a Java 
    compiler, so the JRE is not enough to develop your own Agents.</li>
  <li>The <span class="codefixed">newsagent.jar</span> file distributed with NewsAgent 
    is in your CLASSPATH environment variable. Under most systems, this <i>is 
    not done</i> by the installation program for NewsAgent, and you will have 
    to add it manually.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, you should be fairly familiar with Java programming and using 
  <span class="codefixed">javac</span>, the Java compiler.</p>
<h2>An Example Agent: DemoSendAgent<a name="AnExampleAgent"></a></h2>
<p>An example Send Agent is supplied with NewsAgent. This Agent is not installed 
  by default, but is contained inside the <span class="codefixed">newsagent.jar</span> 
  file. The source code is not distributed with NewsAgent, but is available on 
  the NewsAgent Web Site [link]. You have permission to modify the<span class="codefixed"> 
  DemoSendAgent.java</span> file in any way you like to create your own Agents.</p>
<h2>The ISendAgent &amp; IListAgent Interfaces<a name="Interfaces"></a></h2>
<p>Near the start of the DemoSendAgent.java source file, you will see the lines:</p>
<pre>import uk.ac.st_and.dcs.newsagent.MessageHeader;
import uk.ac.st_and.dcs.newsagent.MessageBody;
import uk.ac.st_and.dcs.newsagent.agent.SendAgentMessage;
import uk.ac.st_and.dcs.newsagent.agent.ISendAgent;
...
public class DemoSendAgent implements ISendAgent {
...</pre>
<p>The classes <a href="http://st-and.compsoc.org.uk/~briand/newsagent/userdoc/advanced/writingagents.html"><img src="../images/hlpWebSite.gif" width="16" height="16" border="0"></a><a href="http://st-and.compsoc.org.uk/%7Ebriand/newsagent/jdocs/uk.ac.st_and.dcs.newsagent.MessageHeader.html" target="">MessageHeader</a>, 
  <a href="http://st-and.compsoc.org.uk/~briand/newsagent/userdoc/advanced/writingagents.html"><img src="../images/hlpWebSite.gif" width="16" height="16" border="0"></a><a href="http://st-and.compsoc.org.uk/%7Ebriand/newsagent/jdocs/uk.ac.st_and.dcs.newsagent.MessageBody.html" target="">MessageBody</a> 
  <a href="http://st-and.compsoc.org.uk/~briand/newsagent/userdoc/advanced/writingagents.html"><img src="../images/hlpWebSite.gif" width="16" height="16" border="0"></a><a href="http://st-and.compsoc.org.uk/%7Ebriand/newsagent/jdocs/uk.ac.st_and.dcs.newsagent.agent.SendAgentMessage.html" target="">SendAgentMessage</a> 
  and interface <a href="http://st-and.compsoc.org.uk/~briand/newsagent/userdoc/advanced/writingagents.html"><img src="../images/hlpWebSite.gif" width="16" height="16" border="0"></a><a href="http://st-and.compsoc.org.uk/%7Ebriand/newsagent/jdocs/uk.ac.st_and.dcs.newsagent.agent.ISendAgent.html" target="">ISendAgent</a> 
  define the way in which your Agents communicate with NewsAgent. Documentation 
  for these three classes is available on the NewsAgent web site (the hyperlinks 
  will take you there). </p>
<p>All Send Agents must implement the ISendAgent interface and all List Agents 
  must implement the IListAgent interface.</p>
<p>The documentation on the web site explains more comprehensively what each of 
  the methods in these interfaces must do. </p>
<p>The most important method in the ISendAgent interface is <a href="http://st-and.compsoc.org.uk/~briand/newsagent/userdoc/advanced/writingagents.html"><img src="../images/hlpWebSite.gif" width="16" height="16" border="0"></a><a href="http://st-and.compsoc.org.uk/%7Ebriand/newsagent/jdocs/uk.ac.st_and.dcs.newsagent.agent.ISendAgent.html#checkMessage(uk.ac.st_and.dcs.newsagent.MessageHeader,%20uk.ac.st_and.dcs.newsagent.MessageBody)">checkMessage(...)</a>. 
  This method is called when the user clicks on the Post button in the <a href="../dialogs/messagecomposer.html">Message 
  Composer</a>. It may process the header and body passed in to it any any way, 
  and then return a <a href="http://st-and.compsoc.org.uk/~briand/newsagent/userdoc/advanced/writingagents.html"><img src="../images/hlpWebSite.gif" width="16" height="16" border="0"></a><a href="http://st-and.compsoc.org.uk/%7Ebriand/newsagent/jdocs/uk.ac.st_and.dcs.newsagent.agent.SendAgentMessage.html" target="">SendAgentMessage</a> 
  telling NewsAgent what to do next.</p>
<p>Similarly, in the IListAgent interface, [blah, blah...]</p>
<h2>Agent Configuration<a name="AgentConfiguration"></a></h2>
<p>Each agent can be configured. The configuration system works using the following 
  methods (which are included in both the ISendAgent and IListAgent interfaces):</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>void applyConfiguration(JPanel)<br>
    </b>Called by NewsAgent when the user chooses to apply the changes they've 
    made to your configuration panel. The panel is returned back to your Agent.<b> 
    </b></li>
  <li><b>JPanel getConfigurationPanel()<br>
    </b>Called by NewsAgent when the user wants to configure your Agent. You should 
    return a JPanel or a subclass of JPanel that provides user interface features 
    to set your Agent's properties. You should return null from this method if 
    your Agent doesn't have a configuration user interface.</li>
  <li><b>Properties getProperties()<br>
    </b>Called by NewsAgent when it needs to know your properties. NewsAgent doesn't 
    care what properties you actually have, but will call this method when the 
    user saves his/her properties to disk, so that agent preferences stay the 
    same from session to session. <i>This means you don't have to worry about 
    saving your agent's properties unless you are doing something unusual.</i> 
    You should not return null from this method, use <span class="codefixed">return 
    new Properties();</span> if you don't want to provide any properties. </li>
  <li><b>setProperties(Properties)<br>
    </b>Called by NewsAgent when it reads the users Agent properties in from disk. 
    This is usually at startup, when NewsAgent is creating and instantiating all 
    its Agents.</li>
</ul>
