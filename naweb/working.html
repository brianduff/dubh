<h1>NewsAgent: SuperConnected!</h1>

<p>Yet another tantalising screenshot from NewsAgent. I've been working over the 
  last few weeks to tie the back &amp; front ends of the application together. 
  The back end involves the actual connections to the network and disk storage. 
  Seems to be working quite well now, and for the first time, you can actually 
  use NewsAgent to read news (about time, probably, since the project is due to 
  be complete in a mere 2 weeks!)</p>
<h2>The Screenshots</h2>
<p>Well, since the last time I put a screenshot online, Sun have decided to change 
  the name of Metal Look &amp; Feel to Java Look &amp; Feel. I thought metal was 
  a better name, but that's just my opinion. Anyway, NewsAgent's main window in 
  Java L&amp;F and Windows L&amp;F is shown below. Click on the pictures to see 
  blown up versions. </p>

<h2 align="LEFT">Notes</h2>
<p>Well, as you can see, a real, live news server connection is active, with a 
  newsgroup selected and a specific message being shown. There are still a few 
  missing features and undoubtedly some bugs, but it seems relatively stable, 
  and not as slow as I had feared.</p>
