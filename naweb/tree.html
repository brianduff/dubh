<h1>NewsAgent: Multi Column Tree</h1>

<p>The first Screenshot I'm putting on the web page is of my Multi Column tree. 
  This is used to provide a hierarchical view of discussion threads in a newsgroup. 
  The columns are resizable, and parts of the tree can be expanded and collapsed 
  by the user.</p>
<h2>The Screenshots</h2>
<p>The first screenshot is the multicolumn tree with some test data under Windows 
  98.</p>
<p align="CENTER"><img src="images/tree_windows.gif" width="456" height="157" alt="Tree Screenshot for Windows"> 
</p>
<p align="LEFT">The second screenshot is exactly the same tree, but running from 
  a DEC Alpha machine on Digital UNIX, under X Windows.</p>

<p align="LEFT">OK, they aren't massively different, but that's the whole point. 
  Java is platform independent, Java is cool!</p>
<h2 align="LEFT">Implementation</h2>
<p align="LEFT">The control uses the JTree Java bean from Swing 0.8. This bean 
  doesn't have any support for multiple columns, so I had to improvise a little.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The <a href="jdocs/uk.ac.st_and.dcs.newsagent.ui.HeaderControl.html">column 
  header</a> is a simple component. It's not quite a bean, but it could easily 
  be made into one. It is simply implemented as a panel which has the column headers 
  manually drawn on it. The header can have any number of columns and the class 
  user can specify and change the widths. A <a href="jdocs/uk.ac.st_and.dcs.newsagent.ui.ThreadTree.html">JTree 
  object </a>must be bound to the column header so that changes in the column 
  widths can fire a repaint event on the JTree.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The JTree subclass is similarly bound to a column header, so it 
  can determine the correct widths of columns. Swing allows the programmer to 
  define a &quot;renderer&quot; for individual items in a JTree, so I created 
  my own CellRenderer which simply paints a number of strings at positions determined 
  by the column header control. </p>
<p align="LEFT">Swing has a few problems (it's in beta, after all), so I had to 
  kludge a little to make things work. In particular, the mechanism whereby selected 
  items are painted is particularly buggy. At one point, I had the renderer drawing 
  a box the entire width of the screen, because the JTree was unaware of the fact 
  that the Renderer components had changed size. I fixed this by drawing individual 
  boxes for each clipping region in the component. There is a single clipping 
  region for each string (column), so the render actually draws n boxes for an 
  n-column tree. I tried originally to use the predefined colours from sun.java.swing.basic.BasicTreeCellRenderer. 
  However, the methods for obtaining colours seem to be a little buggy, and are 
  also different across platforms. I therefore plumped for predefining the colours. 
  Slightly bad practice, but it works, and looks OK.</p>
