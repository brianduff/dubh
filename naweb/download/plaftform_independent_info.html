      <h2>About the Platform Independent Files</h2>
      <p>NewsAgent is written in Java. You can run NewsAgent on any platform that 
        can run Java 1.1.5 or greater (Java 2 is not currently supported). Before 
        you install NewsAgent, you must download and install the Java Runtime 
        Environment (or development kit) from JavaSoft: <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jre">http://java.sun.com/products/jre</a>.</p>
      <h2>File Descriptions</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="../../nadownloads/dubhna.1.0.2.jar.zip">NewsAgent 1.0.2 Build 
          110 JAR</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>This JAR (Java archive) contains the latest version of the NewsAgent 
        executable Java files. </p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="../../nadownloads/dubhju.1.0.1.jar.zip">Dubh Java Utilities 1.0.1 
          Build 10 JAR</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>This JAR contains the latest version of the Dubh Java Utilities. These 
        are common utilities shared by all my applications, and this JAR is required 
        for NewsAgent to work.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="../../nadownloads/swingall.jar.zip">Swing 1.0.2 JAR </a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>This JAR is the Swing (Java Foundation Classes) user interface toolkit. 
        NewsAgent requires Swing 1.0.2 and <b>will not work</b> with an older 
        or newer version. The next major release of NewsAgent will use Swing 1.1 
        (part of Java 2).</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="../../nadownloads/na_doc_1_0_2_110.zip">Zipped HTML User 
          documentation</a> 1.0.2 Build 110 [255 Kb]</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This ZIP file contains the HTML user documentation that is bundled with 
        the Windows distribution and <a href="../userdoc/index.html">available</a> 
        on this web site. The web site version is usually the most up to date.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Windows .exe update</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This will be provided when the next build is released to make upgrading 
        easier.</p>
      <h2>Using NewsAgent on Your Platform</h2>
      <p>These instructions assume you are using a UNIX-like platform. I welcome 
        instructions from users of other platforms on how to make NewsAgent work, 
        these will be added to this web site and credited. Please email <a href="bduff@uk.oracle.com">bduff@uk.oracle.com</a>. 
        It is also possible to use the platform independent distribution under 
        Windows, which might save some download time.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Download the Java runtime environment 1.1.x or development environment 
          if you do not already have it. Add the bin directory to your PATH environment 
          variable. Type<code> java -version</code> at the prompt to verify it 
          is accessible (the version should be 1.1.5 or greater, but less than 
          1.2). </li>
        <li>Create a directory for NewsAgent (e.g. <code>~/newsagent</code>). 
          Download the Dubh Java Utilities and NewsAgent JAR files above. Download 
          Swing 1.0.2 if you do not already have it. Unzip these files. You should now have a directory 
          containing three items like so:<br>
          <ul>
            <li><code>dubhju.1.0.1.jar</code></li>
            <li><code>dubhna.1.0.2.jar</code></li>
            <li><code>swingall.jar</code> </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Set up your CLASSPATH environment variable so that it includes at 
          least these three files and the java runtime JAR file. E.g.:<br>
          <code>set CLASSPATH=~/newsagent/dubhju.1.0.1.jar; ~/newsagent/dubhna.1.0.2.jar; 
          ~/newsagent/swingall.jar; /local/packages/java/lib/classes.zip; .<br>
          </code>(The above is all one line with no spaces).</li>
        <li>Run NewsAgent from the prompt:<br>
          <code>java dubh.apps.newsagent.NewsAgent</code></li>
      </ol>
      <h2>Upgrading an Existing Installation</h2>
      <p>If you have NewsAgent 1.0.2 build 110 or later installed on your machine, 
        you can upgrade it using the platform independent files. This also applies 
        to the Windows installation, saving you from downloading the full installation 
        program each time. Follow these steps to upgrade your installation:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Check which version of NewsAgent (and its libraries) you are currently 
          using. Run NewsAgent and click on About in the help menu. The version 
          numbers are given as major.minor.micro buildnumber [date].</li>
        <li>Check the version of each component. If newer versions of the component 
          are available here, download them. If you have up to date components, 
          there is no need to download them.</li>
        <li><b>For windows:</b> download the Windows .exe update, and copy it 
          into the directory in which you installed NewsAgent (c:\program files\dubh\newsagent 
          by default). Copy the JAR files into the lib subdirectory, overwriting 
          any existing files.<br>
          <b>Other platforms: </b>copy the JAR files into the directory in which 
          you installed NewsAgent, overwriting any existing files. You may need 
          to alter your CLASSPATH if the names of the JAR files has changed.</li>
      </ol>
      <p><i>N.b. You can't upgrade from 1.0.1 to 1.0.2, because NewsAgent has 
        changed substantially (i.e. all three JARs have changed completely). Please 
        do a full download and install.</i></p>
