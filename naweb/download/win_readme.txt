o Installing the Windows distribution **************************************

 - Unzip the distribution file. You will need pkunzip or Winzip 
   (www.winzip.com) to do this.

 - Move the "newsagent" folder somewhere you want to keep it (for instance
   c:\program files\newsagent)

 - Edit the newsagent.bat file in the newsagent directory. By default it
   assumes you installed newsagent in c:\program files\newsagent. If this
   is not the case, you will have to change the occurrence of this
   string in the batch file to wherever you installed the program.

 - Double click on the newsagent.bat file to run NewsAgent.

 - Wait. It might take a while before anything happens.

o Troubleshooting Problems ***********************************************

 - java or jre couldn't be found: Make sure you have correctly
   installed Java. See http://java.sun.com/ for more details.

 - Class not found: Check that the paths in the batch file are correct and
   you have Java and Swing 1.0 installed properly.

 - NewsAgent is slow: Get a faster machine / Java Runtime implementation / 
   complain to JavaSoft.
