<h1>NewsAgent: All Dialogs</h1>

<p>This is another NewsAgent screenshot. This time, I've put together all the 
  dialogs in the application that are currently implemented (with the exception 
  of some really minor ones), and created a 1024x768 screenshot of them. </p>
<h2>The Screenshots</h2>
<p>This is what they look like - click on the thumbnail to see the full picture 
  (it's big). I'm using the Metal pluggable look &amp; feel at the moment, I might 
  get round to putting a Windows look &amp; feel version up here some time...</p>

<h2 align="LEFT">Implementation</h2>
<p>Not much to say really. I've been working on Internationalising the strings 
  in the application, and at the moment I even have some test German and French 
  resource files. Everything seems to work quite nicely.</p>
<p>I spent most of today (6 Mar 98) working on the Signature options (the two 
  small dialogs in the left bottom corner). Most of the work was getting the list 
  to work consistently, and the behind the scenes code which stores the information 
  in user preference files. These, coincidentally are the two Internationalised 
  dialogs so far.</p>
