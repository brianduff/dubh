<H1>Why the delay?</H1>

<P>
Sorry about that! A new version was due to be released at the start of July 
1998, but I fell behind schedule. I'm currently training for my new job at
<A HREF=www.oracle.com>Oracle</A>. When the training is done, I'll try to
find some free time to look at NewsAgent again.
</P><P>
The next release will be pretty much what I have on my development platform
today, but with some minor release finishing touches. This will be the last
1.x release of NewsAgent: work on 2.0 has already begun.
