<H1>NewsAgent 1.1.0 Release Schedule</H1>
<P><I><FONT COLOR="#CC9900">Clearly the contents of this page are a pile of rotting fish remains. I really shouldn't
make half arsed promises I'll never keep &lt;sigh&gt;.</FONT></I></P>

<P>These are approximate release dates for various milestones of NewsAgent 1.1.0. Being a somewhat lazy bugger
occasionally, these almost certainly will slip (I have a slightly sceptical view of the concept of a deadline.
This is a natural and required trait for any software engineer).</P>

<P>The feature set listed here assumes that no-one else offers to contribute. I'm beginning to get the impression
that open source software has to be half decent before anyone will contribute to it, and NewsAgent isn't quite
there yet. If, however, the universe stuns me completely, and some contributors do turn up, the release schedule
could quicken, or find itself burdened with many more features. (for the record, there are a couple of registered
contributors with CVS access to the source, but they don't seem to be very active).</P>

<P>The idea is that milestone releases will be available as installable alpha downloads of NewsAgent. These should
be relatively stable builds. The features for each milestone are split into &quot;musts&quot; and &quot;shoulds&quot;.
A milestone will slip if a must isn't going to make it into the release. Shoulds can slip to become musts in later
milestones.</P>

<P>So, I'm not promising anything, but here goes... (btw. the milestones are all named after characters from scifi
novels. Yes, I am sad.)</P>

<P>Bug fix release / slippage space</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>So there you go. After that, who knows? If people want to contribute after 1.1.0, I might consider continuing
work on it. Otherwise, it's probably time for me to try something new.</P>
