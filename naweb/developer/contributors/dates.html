<h1>NewsAgent 1.1.0 Release Schedule</h1>
<p> These are approximate release dates for various milestones of NewsAgent 1.1.0. 
  Being a somewhat lazy bugger occasionally, these almost certainly will slip 
  (I have a slightly sceptical view of the concept of a deadline. This is a natural 
  and required trait for any software engineer).</p>
<p>The feature set listed here assumes that no-one else offers to contribute. 
  I'm beginning to get the impression that open source software has to be half 
  decent before anyone will contribute to it, and NewsAgent isn't quite there 
  yet. If, however, the universe stuns me completely, and some contributors do 
  turn up, the release schedule could quicken, or find itself burdened with many 
  more features. (for the record, there are a couple of registered contributors 
  with CVS access to the source, but they don't seem to be very active).</p>
<p>The idea is that milestone releases will be available as installable alpha 
  downloads of NewsAgent. These should be relatively stable builds. The features 
  for each milestone are split into &quot;musts&quot; and &quot;shoulds&quot;. 
  A milestone will slip if a must isn't going to make it into the release. Shoulds 
  can slip to become musts in later milestones.</p>
<p>So, I'm not promising anything, but here goes... (btw. the milestones are all 
  named after characters from scifi novels. Yes, I am sad.)</p>
<h2>Milestone Gurgeh: 30 November 1999 (pre-alpha)&nbsp; </h2>

<p>So there you go. After that, who knows? If people want to contribute after 
  1.1.0, I might consider continuing work on it. Otherwise, it's probably time 
  for me to try something new.</p>
