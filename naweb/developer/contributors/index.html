<h3>[16 October 1999]: I'm back!</h3>
<p>After a long absence, I've started writing code for NewsAgent again. &quot;Real&quot; 
  work has been (and continues to be) quite hectic (we're fast approaching beta), 
  so although I can't promise that I'll be spending more time on NewsAgent, I'll 
  see what I can do.</p>
<p>Checked in some code today in the dmp module. The new networking code can now 
  be partially tested; it successfully retrieves the list of newsgroups from the 
  server as JavaMail Folder objects. There are still performance problems, and 
  support has to be added for NNTP extensions, but it's nice to see the networking 
  code ... er. .working again.</p>
<p>Changes can be picked up in tomorrow morning's DMP autobuild. Configure and 
  run <tt>dubh.mail.nntp.test.NNTPTest</tt> to see it in action.</p>
<p>The wired.dcs.st-and.ac.uk domain name has been discontinued. If you're using 
  this domain name, use st-and.compsoc.org.uk (or wired.st-and.ac.uk) instead. 
  You may need to re-checkout any CVS files if you had been using the old name.</p>
<p>Had some thoughts about the UI and possibly using XUL (see <a href="http://www.mozilla.org">www.mozilla.org</a>) 
  or something similar. This might require a large amount of work though. Anyone 
  interested in helping???</p>
<h3>[09 June 1999 (later)]: Release dates for NewsAgent 1.1.0</h3>
<p>
   OK, not promising anything, but... I thought I'd set some possible
   <a href="dates.html">release dates and feature lists</a>
   for alphas & betas of 1.1.0. This way, 
   I might be more inclined to actually work on NewsAgent when I have a
   chance (I've started doing strange things like watching football on
   TV recently, I really need to make more constructive use of my free time
   before I turn into an earthy root vegetable perched on the edge of my 
   seatee).
</p>
<h3>[09 June 1999]: Source snapshots for DMP available</h3>
<p>
   DMP now builds in the autobuild. The source is available from the snapshots
   page (see above). It compiles, but still isn't being used (and is far from
   finished).
</p>
<p>
   Various changes to autobuild mean that the CVS log is not being displayed
   properly in nightly build emails and on the snapshots page. I'll fix this
   soon.
</p>
<p>
   Snapshot ZIPs no longer contain CVS directories (hence the drop in file size).
</p>

<h3>[07 June 1999]: New CVS module & updated build scripts</h3>
<p>
   A new CVS module (dmp) is available containing an implementation of an NNTP store
   for JavaMail. This will soon be used instead of the dubh.apps.newsagent.nntp
   package (lots of code from NNTPServer.java has moved into NNTPStore.java in the
   new source tree). This code doesn't compile yet, and is not yet used, so is not
   autobuilt. Please ask before checking into this module. The networking code is
   my top priority now.
</p>
<p>
   A common build script (bin/buildmodule, available in the dubhbuild CVS module)
   has been created that performs the work of building a module. Most of the code
   came from buildna and buildju, which were pretty similar. Now buildna and 
   builddju (and the new builddmp) all call buildmodule with different arguments.
   The build scripts can be configured to run outside the st-and.compsoc.org.uk
   server, please let me know if you have any success doing this.
</p>
<p>
   Fixed a small locale specific bug in the DJU (build 53) that was causing
   exceptions to be thrown in non UK locales. This was due to parsing a date
   using DateFormat.parse(..), which uses fundamentally different patterns in
   different locales, it seems (regardless of how much I tried, I couldn't work
   out what format it wanted the date to be in in a US locale). I've now
   specified my own format with SimpleDateFormat, which works without hassle
   in both locales.
