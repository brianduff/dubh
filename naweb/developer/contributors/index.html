<h3>[07 June 1999]: New CVS module & updated build scripts</h3>
<p>
   A new CVS module (dmp) is available containing an implementation of an NNTP store
   for JavaMail. This will soon be used instead of the dubh.apps.newsagent.nntp
   package (lots of code from NNTPServer.java has moved into NNTPStore.java in the
   new source tree). This code doesn't compile yet, and is not yet used, so is not
   autobuilt. Please ask before checking into this module. The networking code is
   my top priority now.
</p>
<p>
   A common build script (bin/buildmodule, available in the dubhbuild CVS module)
   has been created that performs the work of building a module. Most of the code
   came from buildna and buildju, which were pretty similar. Now buildna and 
   builddju (and the new builddmp) all call buildmodule with different arguments.
   The build scripts can be configured to run outside the st-and.compsoc.org.uk
   server, please let me know if you have any success doing this.
</p>
<p>
   Fixed a small locale specific bug in the DJU (build 53) that was causing
   exceptions to be thrown in non UK locales. This was due to parsing a date
   using DateFormat.parse(..), which uses fundamentally different patterns in
   different locales, it seems (regardless of how much I tried, I couldn't work
   out what format it wanted the date to be in in a US locale). I've now
   specified my own format with SimpleDateFormat, which works without hassle
   in both locales.
