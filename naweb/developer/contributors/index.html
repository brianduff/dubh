<h3>[23 October 1999]: Navigator &amp; Command System</h3>
<p>Another massive coding session today. Good news is that the navigator is working, 
  and is all funky and dynamic. I even felt so confident that I put it in the 
  main window of NewsAgent for the whole world to see. Gone forever is the old 
  FolderTreePanel. If you feel like trying this out on another system, you might 
  find it slightly fiddly at the moment, because the property file lookup isn't 
  entirely flexible (and there may be some hard coded paths at the moment). Oh, 
  also, the navigator doesn't talk to the rest of NewsAgent yet, so the application 
  is pretty useless until I rewrite the ThreadTree and integrate the new MessageViewer 
  stuff.</p>
<p>There is now a new package in DJU called dubh.utils.command. This contains 
  various classes and interfaces to support the general idea of a command in an 
  application. The commands support undo and redo and integrate with JFC Actions. 
  I've used these commands in the navigator extensively, this means that the user 
  can just plug in new commands for things in the navigator by providing the classname 
  of an object that implements dubh.utils.command.Command. There is only one command 
  in existence at the moment (Add Server... on the News Server service). It doesn't 
  do anything other than print out it's name, but I should have it invoking the 
  (new and improved) Server properties dialog tomorrow.</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<h3>[17 October 1999]: Navigator and Viewer</h3>
<p>Well, with DMP in a testable (but not entirely complete) state, I've temporarily 
  switched back to doing stuff for NewsAgent itself again. </p>
<p>I managed to get the JavaBeans activation framework to use my viewers for text/plain 
  and text/html content types, but the multipart/mixed one is a bit stuffed for 
  some reason. Nice to see HTML messages working, you can try this out using the 
  test harness described in yesterdays &quot;news&quot;. More viewers still need 
  to be written (e.g. for images).</p>
<p>Rewrote the message header display control; this should now be usable in either 
  the viewer or the composer. It also supports pluggable editors, so cusomized 
  controls can be used to edit or view specific headers (e.g. an LDAP lookup button 
  for From fields etc.)</p>
<p>Started work on rewriting the underlying model for the navigator (tree control 
  on the LHS). The really sexy thing is that it is now customizable, allowing 
  new services to be added just by editing .properties files (with UI interfaces 
  to this a possibility). This has been written to tie in with activation and 
  javamail, so in theory any javamail provider or transport service can be hooked 
  into the navigator. This means we can now support POP, IMAP and SMTP email using 
  Sun's providers and transports for those protocols, and of course NNTP using 
  the DMP provider.</p>
<p>None of these changes are currently viewable from the main application window. 
  Until the navigator is working, I don't plan to alter MainFrame, but this should 
  be in a working state shortly.</p>
<h3>[16 October 1999]: I'm back!</h3>
<p>After a long absence, I've started writing code for NewsAgent again. &quot;Real&quot; 
  work has been (and continues to be) quite hectic (we're fast approaching beta), 
  so although I can't promise that I'll be spending more time on NewsAgent, I'll 
  see what I can do.</p>
<p>Checked in some code today in the dmp module. The new networking code can now 
  be partially tested; it successfully retrieves the list of newsgroups from the 
  server as JavaMail Folder objects. There are still performance problems, and 
  support has to be added for NNTP extensions, but it's nice to see the networking 
  code ... er. .working again.</p>
<p>Changes can be picked up in tomorrow morning's DMP autobuild. Configure and 
  run <tt>dubh.mail.nntp.test.NNTPTest</tt> to see it in action.</p>
<p>The wired.dcs.st-and.ac.uk domain name has been discontinued. If you're using 
  this domain name, use st-and.compsoc.org.uk (or wired.st-and.ac.uk) instead. 
  You may need to re-checkout any CVS files if you had been using the old name.</p>
<p>Had some thoughts about the UI and possibly using XUL (see <a href="http://www.mozilla.org">www.mozilla.org</a>) 
  or something similar. This might require a large amount of work though. Anyone 
  interested in helping???</p>
<h3>[09 June 1999 (later)]: Release dates for NewsAgent 1.1.0</h3>
<p>
   OK, not promising anything, but... I thought I'd set some possible
   <a href="dates.html">release dates and feature lists</a>
   for alphas & betas of 1.1.0. This way, 
   I might be more inclined to actually work on NewsAgent when I have a
   chance (I've started doing strange things like watching football on
   TV recently, I really need to make more constructive use of my free time
   before I turn into an earthy root vegetable perched on the edge of my 
   seatee).
</p>
<h3>[09 June 1999]: Source snapshots for DMP available</h3>
<p>
   DMP now builds in the autobuild. The source is available from the snapshots
   page (see above). It compiles, but still isn't being used (and is far from
   finished).
</p>
<p>
   Various changes to autobuild mean that the CVS log is not being displayed
   properly in nightly build emails and on the snapshots page. I'll fix this
   soon.
</p>
<p>
   Snapshot ZIPs no longer contain CVS directories (hence the drop in file size).
</p>

<h3>[07 June 1999]: New CVS module & updated build scripts</h3>
<p>
   A new CVS module (dmp) is available containing an implementation of an NNTP store
   for JavaMail. This will soon be used instead of the dubh.apps.newsagent.nntp
   package (lots of code from NNTPServer.java has moved into NNTPStore.java in the
   new source tree). This code doesn't compile yet, and is not yet used, so is not
   autobuilt. Please ask before checking into this module. The networking code is
   my top priority now.
</p>
<p>
   A common build script (bin/buildmodule, available in the dubhbuild CVS module)
   has been created that performs the work of building a module. Most of the code
   came from buildna and buildju, which were pretty similar. Now buildna and 
   builddju (and the new builddmp) all call buildmodule with different arguments.
   The build scripts can be configured to run outside the st-and.compsoc.org.uk
   server, please let me know if you have any success doing this.
</p>
<p>
   Fixed a small locale specific bug in the DJU (build 53) that was causing
   exceptions to be thrown in non UK locales. This was due to parsing a date
   using DateFormat.parse(..), which uses fundamentally different patterns in
   different locales, it seems (regardless of how much I tried, I couldn't work
   out what format it wanted the date to be in in a US locale). I've now
   specified my own format with SimpleDateFormat, which works without hassle
   in both locales.
