<h1>NewsAgent Contributors Information</h1>
<h2>How to Become a Contributor</h2>
<p>To become a contributor, fill out the short <a href="forms/application.html">application form</a>. Submit this, 
  and I'll email you with details of your CVS account within a few days. You should 
  have an idea about an area of NewsAgent you would like to work on or improve.</p>
<h2>How to Access the Source</h2>
<p>The source code is held on a CVS server on st-and.compsoc.org. CVS (concurrent 
  version system) is a revision control system that keeps track of old versions 
  of files and is useful in a development project involving lots of people. More 
  information on CVS is available at <a href="http://www.cyclic.com">http://www.cyclic.com</a>. You will need to download 
  some kind of CVS client for your machine to be able to access the NewsAgent 
  source repository. If you want a graphical client, I recommend WinCVS, a free 
  CVS client written for Windows and released under the GNU GPL.</p>
<p>When your register as a contributor, you'll be given a username and password. 
  You should then point your CVS client at the server; it has the following details:</p>
<p>CVS Server: <b>st-and.compsoc.org.uk<br>
  </b>CVS repository: <b>/home/briand/cvsroot</b><br>
  Connection method: <b>Pserver</b></p>
<p>The following CVS modules are available:</p>
<p><b>najava:</b> NewsAgent java source code.<br>
  <b>dju:</b> Common code<br>
  <b>dmp:</b> (NEW) Dubh Mail Protocols (JavaMail implementation for NNTP)<br>
  <b>nawin32: </b>NewsAgent windows launcher C files<br>
  <b>dubhbuild: </b>Nightly build scripts<br>
  <b>nareadme: </b>Readme files for NewsAgent distributions<br>
  <b>nawininstall: </b>NewsAgent InstallShield files (warning: contains long filenames
   with spaces)<br>
  <b>naweb: </b>NewsAgent Web Site HTML (refreshed every hour)<br>

</p>
<p>The most useful ones to most contributors will be najava and dju. </p>
<h2>Checking Out</h2>
<p>To check out NewsAgent and begin to make some changes, you should connect your 
  client to the CVS server and perform a checkout of the relevant modules. To 
  work on NewsAgent, you will probably need both the najava and dju modules, unless 
  you have a recent dju JAR file in your CLASSPATH. More information on how to 
  check out files is available in the documentation for your client. For detailed 
  CVS documentation, see <a href="http://www.loria.fr/~molli/cvs">http://www.loria.fr/~molli/cvs/</a>.</p>
<h2>Making Changes</h2>
<p>Please use a consistent coding style when making changes. There are no hard 
  and fast rules here, but in general, it's a good idea to try to keep things 
  consistent for maintainability.</p>
<h3>End of Line Format</h3>
<p>Files should be UNIX style text files. If any existing files use MSDOS eol 
  characters, feel free to convert them.</p>
<h3>Tabs</h3>
<p>Generally, it's a bad idea to use hard tabs (i.e. ASCII 9, proper tab characters), 
  because the way in which these are represented varies from platform to platform. 
  Instead, try to use space characters. Although the current source isn't consistent, 
  I'd recommend using three space characters for indenting.</p>
<h3>Curly Braces</h3>
<p>The current code is completely inconsistent with regard to curly braces. I've 
  been conditioned at my place of work into using the following style, which I 
  now prefer. However, I'm not too bothered by this issue, provided the code is 
  readable...</p>
<pre>if ( something )
{
   doSomething();
} </pre>
<h3>Comments</h3>
<p>Comment your code. Use Javadoc comments whenever possible before methods, fields 
  or classes. Use comments inside methods to describe tricky implementations. 
  Don't overcomment (e.g. this is a loop that counts from 1 to 10). Use /**...*/ 
  style comments for Javadoc comments only, use // for all other comments (this 
  allows blocks of code to be commented out more easily). </p>
<p>Some source files have version histories in comments at the top. There is no 
  longer any need to add information to these histories, since CVS now logs changes. 
  Please do not remove these histories. Please don't modify the licence at the 
  top of the source files, except to add your name as a contributor. <br>
</p>
<h2>Checking In</h2>
<p>Before checking any code into the repository, please <b>make sure it builds 
  </b>and ideally works too. I recommend you use the same compiler as the build 
  process to make sure that your checkins are not going to break the build (see 
  below).</p>
<p>Again, consult your CVS client documentation on how to check files in. You 
  should make sure you provide suitable comments for the log on what has changed.</p>
<p>Whenever you make changes, I also ask that you fill out a <a href="forms/checkin.html">checkin report</a>. 
  The contents of this form will be mailed to all contributors.</p>
<h2>Build Process</h2>
<p>A full build of all Java based components (both NewsAgent and the DJU) is performed 
  every night, and the results are mailed out to all contributors and displayed 
  on the archives page on <a href="http://www.egroups.com/list/dubh-contributors">
  egroups</a>.
  You may wish to download the nightly build scripts to verify that your source 
  builds locally before checking in. These scripts are written for bash (a UNIX 
  shell) and can be found in the build module.</p>
<p>The build process uses Jikes for Linux as the compiler with the Java 1.2 rt.jar 
  in the CLASSPATH. For NewsAgent, mail.jar (JavaMail) and activation.jar (JavaBeans 
  Activation Framework, required by JavaMail) are also included in the CLASSPATH. 
  To make sure that your code builds properly, please check that it compiles cleanly 
  with Jikes (available from <a href="http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com">
  the IBM AlphaWorks site</a>). Jikes is stricter 
  than javac, so will sometimes throw errors with things that javac lets by. </p>
<h2>Mailing List</h2>
<p>
  All mail to contributors is sent to the dubh-contributors mailing list on
  egroups. To join this mailing list, enter your email address below. This
  list recieves nightly build reports (only if code has actually changed) and
  checkin reports, as well as general contributor discussions. You can send
  messages to the list by emailing <a href=mailto:dubh-contributors@egroups.com>
  dubh-contributors@egroups.com</a>. You can also view all past messages,
  subscribe and unsubscribe on the web at <a href=http://www.egroups.com/list/dubh-contributors>

We also have a mailing list that users can join to get general information
about NewsAgent. Only contributors are allowed to post to this list, but
anyone can join. To post, send mail to newsagent-announce@egroups.com. View
the archive, subscribe yourself and control the group from 
<a href="http://www.egroups.com/list/newsagent-announce">the egroups site</a>.

<h2>Bug Database</h2>
<p>
There is a bug database at <a href="../../bugs/">http://st-and.compsoc.org.uk/~briand/newsagent/bugs</a>.
This uses wreq, which is not ideal, but at least it works.
