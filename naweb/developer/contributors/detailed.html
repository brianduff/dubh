<H1>NewsAgent Contributors Information</H1>
<H2>How to Become a Contributor</H2>
<P>To become a contributor, send me some email (<A HREF="mailto:brian@dubh.org">brian@dubh.org</A>). Let me know
what you're interested in helping out with...</P>
<H2>How to Access the Source</H2>
<P>The source code is held on a CVS server on st-and.compsoc.org. CVS (concurrent version system) is a revision
control system that keeps track of old versions of files and is useful in a development project involving lots
of people. More information on CVS is available at <A HREF="http://www.cyclic.com">http://www.cyclic.com</A>. You
will need to download some kind of CVS client for your machine to be able to access the NewsAgent source repository.
If you want a graphical client, I recommend WinCVS, a free CVS client written for Windows and released under the
GNU GPL. </P>

<P><I>&lt;plug&gt;Scarily enough, I've recently become involved in developing SCM support in Oracle's JDeveloper
IDE. I'm personally very keen to integrate CVS, although at the moment, our main priorities are Oracle Repository,
PVCS and ClearCase support. Nevertheless, if I can possibly get away with implementing CVS support for JDeveloper
5.0, I will. You can download JDeveloper 3.1.1.2 at </I><A HREF="http://technet.oracle.com/software/products/jdev/software_index.htm"><I>http://technet.oracle.com/software/products/jdev/software_index.htm</I></A><I>
(free registration required).&lt;/plug&gt;</I></P>

<P>When your register as a contributor, you'll be given a username and password. You should then point your CVS
client at the server; it has the following details:</P>

<P>CVS Server: <B>dubh.org<BR>
</B>CVS repository: <B>/usr/local/cvsroot</B><BR>
Connection method: <B>Pserver</B></P>

<P>The following CVS modules are available:</P>

<P><B>na:</B> NewsAgent source code, installshield files, win32 launcher and user documentation.<BR>
<B>dju:</B> Common utility code<BR>
<B>dmp:</B> Mail Providers (JavaMail implementation for NNTP)<BR>
<B>naweb:</B> The whole of the NewsAgent web site</P>

<P><I>Nb. For a while, NewsAgent, DJU and DMP were part of the <A HREF="http://jfa.javalobby.org">JFA</A></I> <I>project.
However, this project seems to have dramatically flatlined (at least its mailing list has carried no messages for
several months). So, I've decided to move NewsAgent etc. back out of JFA again. The package namespace will change
one day from org.javalobby to org.dubh, and the licence will (probably) revert back to GPL. Sorry for all the buggering
about.</I></P>
<H2>Checking Out</H2>
<P>To check out NewsAgent and begin to make some changes, you should connect your client to the CVS server and
perform a checkout of the relevant modules. To work on NewsAgent, you will probably need both the na, dju and dmp
modules, unless you have recent dju and dmp JAR files in your CLASSPATH. More information on how to check out files
is available in the documentation for your client. For detailed CVS documentation, see <A HREF="http://www.loria.fr/~molli/cvs">http://www.loria.fr/~molli/cvs/</A>.</P>
<H2>Making Changes</H2>
<P>Please use a consistent coding style when making changes. There are no hard and fast rules here, but in general,
it's a good idea to try to keep things consistent for maintainability.</P>
<H3>End of Line Format</H3>
<P>Files should be UNIX style text files. If any existing files use MSDOS eol characters, feel free to convert
them.</P>
<H3>Tabs</H3>
<P>Generally, it's a bad idea to use hard tabs (i.e. ASCII 9, proper tab characters), because the way in which
these are represented varies from platform to platform. Instead, try to use space characters. Although the current
source isn't consistent, I'd recommend using three space characters for indenting.</P>
<H3>Curly Braces</H3>
<P>The current code is completely inconsistent with regard to curly braces. I've been conditioned at my place of
work into using the following style, which I now prefer. However, I'm not too bothered by this issue, provided
the code is readable...</P>
<PRE>if ( something )
{
   doSomething();
} </PRE>
<H3>Comments</H3>
<P>Comment your code. Use Javadoc comments whenever possible before methods, fields or classes. Use comments inside
methods to describe tricky implementations. Don't overcomment (e.g. this is a loop that counts from 1 to 10). Use
/**...*/ style comments for Javadoc comments only, use // for all other comments (this allows blocks of code to
be commented out more easily).</P>
<P>Some source files have version histories in comments at the top. There is no longer any need to add information
to these histories, since CVS now logs changes. Please do not remove these histories. Please don't modify the licence
at the top of the source files, except to add your name as a contributor. </P>
<H2>Checking In</H2>
<P>Before checking any code into the repository, please <B>make sure it builds </B>and ideally works too. I recommend
you use the same compiler as the build process to make sure that your checkins are not going to break the build
(see below).</P>
<P>Again, consult your CVS client documentation on how to check files in. You should make sure you provide suitable
comments for the log on what has changed.</P>
<H2>Build Process</H2>
<P><B>The nightly builds have not been moved to the new CVS server yet.</B></P>

<P>A full build of all Java based components (both NewsAgent and the DJU) is performed every night, and the results
are mailed out to all contributors and displayed on the archives page on <A HREF="http://www.egroups.com/list/dubh-contributors">egroups</A>.
You may wish to download the nightly build scripts to verify that your source builds locally before checking in.
These scripts are written for bash (a UNIX shell) and can be found in the build module. [it should be easier to
get this working now that I have my own dedicated server].</P>

<P>The build process uses Jikes for Linux as the compiler with the Java 1.2 rt.jar in the CLASSPATH. For NewsAgent,
mail.jar (JavaMail) and activation.jar (JavaBeans Activation Framework, required by JavaMail) are also included
in the CLASSPATH. To make sure that your code builds properly, please check that it compiles cleanly with Jikes
(available from <A HREF="http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com">the IBM AlphaWorks site</A>). Jikes is stricter than javac,
so will sometimes throw errors with things that javac lets by.</P>
<H2>Mailing List</H2>
<P>All mail to contributors is sent to the dubh-contributors mailing list on egroups. To join this mailing list,
enter your email address below. This list recieves nightly build reports (only if code has actually changed) and
checkin reports, as well as general contributor discussions. You can send messages to the list by emailing <A HREF="mailto:dubh-contributors@egroups.com">dubh-contributors@egroups.com</A>.
You can also view all past messages, subscribe and unsubscribe on the web at <A HREF="http://www.egroups.com/list/dubh-contributors">http://www.egroups.com/list/dubh-contributors</A>.</P>

<P>We also have a mailing list that users can join to get general information about NewsAgent. Only contributors
are allowed to post to this list, but anyone can join. To post, send mail to newsagent-announce@egroups.com. View
the archive, subscribe yourself and control the group from <A HREF="http://www.egroups.com/list/newsagent-announce">the
egroups site</A>. [These mailing lists are officially dead at the moment, I'm hoping to get majordomo set up on
my own server for NewsAgent when I get round to it].</P>
<H2>Bug Database</H2>
<P>There is a bug database at <A HREF="../../bugs/">http://st-and.compsoc.org.uk/~briand/newsagent/bugs</A>. This
uses wreq, which is not ideal, but at least it works. <!--#include virtual="../../../footer.html" --> [I'm hoping
to replace this soon with something more funky].
