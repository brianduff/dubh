<h3>What is a license anyway?</h3>
<p>
In order to download NewsAgent, you had to agree to the license agreement
that was supplied on the downloads page. In version 1.0, the license
agreement wasn't very detailed. In the current version (1.01) and all
future versions, the license agreement has been changed to the <a
href="../../download/licence.html">GNU General Public License</a>.
</p><p>
NewsAgent is intended to be free software, and the GNU General Public
License enforces this in the most comprehensive way. It exists to
guarantee your freedom to share and change NewsAgent, to the betterment of
the application itself.
<h3>What does the License give me the right to do?</h3>
<p>
The License gives you the right to copy and distribute NewsAgent as you
see fit, and even charge a small fee for it, provided the fee is used to
cover distribution and media costs. If you do redistribute NewsAgent, it
must be redistributed with its copyright intact, and with the GNU General
Public License, which distributees must agree to before accepting the
distribution.
</p><p>
The License also permits you to distribute works based on the program
(derivative works), provided they too are distributed under the GNU
General Public License and that source code is available for all
modifications you make.
