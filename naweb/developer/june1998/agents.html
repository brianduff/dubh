<h3>What Are Agents?</h3>
<p>From the beginning, NewsAgent was intented to be as extensible as possible. 
  The idea of agents originally sprung from the requirement that NewsAgent should 
  be able to process outgoing messages in some way to make sure they don't contain 
  common mistakes before being posted to a news server. This gave rise to the 
  idea of distinct modules that looked for specific problems in message text and 
  that could be turned on and off by the user. Agents are an extension of this 
  idea: plug-in modules can be provided to examine the message text of outgoing 
  articles, and to process incoming headers.</p>
<p>These two distinct tasks are represented by two types of agent in NewsAgent. 
  SendAgents come into play when a message is being posted to a news server, and 
  can process and modify outgoing message body and header text. ListAgents are 
  invoked when the list of messages are read in from a news server. They can examine 
  the header fields of messages and change the way those headers are displayed, 
  and even delete messages before the user can see them.</p>
<h3>How to Create an Agent</h3>
<table border="0" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
  <tr>
    <td width="77%" valign="TOP">
      <p>We'll begin by considering how to construct an agent, describing some 
        principles that are the same regardless of which type of agent you wish 
        to create. </p>
      <p>Firstly, writing an agent requires you to have NewsAgent installed on 
        your system. You should make sure you are using the latest version. Although 
        the core agent technology isn't expected to change much and should remain 
        backwards compatible, bear in mind that NewsAgent is beta software, and 
        functionality may be added to the agent system in future versions of the 
        application. NewsAgent must be installed and the .jar file (or naclass 
        directory under windows) included in your CLASSPATH.</p>
      <p>You will also have to be reasonably competent at writing and compiling 
        Java programs. Java is a relatively easy language to learn and is quite 
        similar to C++ in many ways. You should have a Java compiler installed 
        on your system: the Java Development Kit supplied by JavaSoft or a good 
        IDE such as Borland JBuilder would be ideal.</p>
      <p>The final two requirements are a text editor (or IDE) for writing Java 
        code and a web browser for browsing the documentation on the interfaces 
        between agents and the NewsAgent application.</p>

      <ul>

        <li>A text editor to edit Java source code files.</li>
        <li>A web browser to refer to the agent programmer's documentation.</li>
      </ul>

<h3>How Agents Talk to NewsAgent</h3>
<p>To make it easier to understand agents, we'll provide a brief overview of how 
  agents interact with the rest of NewsAgent. The AgentManager is a component 
  of NewsAgent which maintains a list of active Send and List Agents. When the 
  &quot;Send&quot; button is clicked in the Message Composer dialogue, the message 
  is first sent to the Agent Manager, which passes it in sequence to all of the 
  currently active Send Agents. Each Send Agent is allowed to modify the message, 
  prevent it from being posted and display messages to the user depending on the 
  content of the message. If all the Send Agents permit the message to be posted, 
  it is sent to the news server.</p>
<p>When a header (usually one of a sequence of headers) is read in from the news 
  server, it is added to a cache and then passed to the Agent Manager. The Agent 
  Manager passes the message header through all the currently active list agents, 
  which may modify header fields. Additionally, list agents can change the formatting 
  that will be used to display the message header in the conversation thread panel 
  (e.g. its font), or delete a message so that the user never sees it.</p>
<p align="CENTER"><img src="agent_architecture.gif" width="458" height="235" border="2" alt="The Agent Architecture"></p>
<p align="LEFT">The final component of the Agent Manager is the saving and restoring 
  of agent properties. Each agent (whether a list or send agent) has a set of 
  associated properties. NewsAgent doesn't care what these properties are: they 
  are included to let agent designers add configuration options to their agents 
  so that the user can change the behaviour of agents. It is the job of the Agent 
  Manager (and <b>not</b> individual agents) to make sure these properties are 
  saved and restored when the program is exited and started.</p>
<h3 align="LEFT">Interface to the User</h3>
<p align="LEFT">There are a number of user interface related aspects to Agents. 
  As mentioned previously, agents can be switched on and off by the user. Additionally, 
  the configuration of individual agents has been alluded to.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The preferences dialogue contains two property sheets for controlling 
  agents. These panels are very similar; the picture below is of the Send Agent 
  configuration panel. The panels can be used to switch agents on and off, change 
  the order in which agents are invoked, add agents and configure individual agents 
  (using the <b>Configure...</b> button).</p>
<p align="CENTER"><img src="../../userdoc/images/dlg_prefs_listagents.gif" width="394" height="458" alt="List Agents property sheet"></p>
<p align="LEFT">As described above, agents can have a set of properties associated 
  with them. The Configure... button is intended to allow the agent's programmer 
  to provide a user interface for setting these properties. Each agent can provide 
  a JPanel (or subclass of JPanel) that contains user interface elements for configuring 
  the agent. This panel is displayed inside a modal dialogue box with OK and Cancel 
  buttons. If the user clicks OK, the agent is allowed to examine the contents 
  of the panel again and change its properties depending on how the user has changed 
  the user interface components in the panel. </p>
<p align="LEFT">One of the ListAgents provided with NewsAgent marks messages that 
  haven't been read differently from those that have. Its configuration panel 
  is shown below, as it appears when the user clicks on the Configure... button.</p>
<p align="CENTER"><img src="../../images/readagent_preview.gif" width="317" height="334" alt="Unread Message Highlighter Configuration Panel"></p>
<h3>The Demo List Agent</h3>
<p>List agents are most fully implemented in the current version of NewsAgent. 
  A demonstration list agent is provided that you can modify to create your own 
  list agents. In this section, we'll step through the source code for the Demo 
  List agent and describe the IListAgent interface in detail by doing so.</p>
<p>You can <a href="DemoListAgent.java.txt">view</a> or <a href="DemoListAgent.java">download</a> 
  the DemoListAgent.java source code.</p>
<p class="codesnippet">package uk.ac.st_and.dcs.newsagent.agent;<br>
  <br>
  ...<br>
  import uk.ac.st_and.dcs.newsagent.MessageHeader;<br>
  import uk.ac.st_and.dcs.newsagent.MessageBody;<br>
  import uk.ac.st_and.dcs.newsagent.agent.IListAgent;<br>
  import uk.ac.st_and.dcs.newsagent.agent.ListAgentMessage;<br>
  ...</p>
<p>The package statement tells the Java compiler where the compiled class file 
  should be stored in the classpath. NewsAgent doesn't care what package you put 
  Agents in, although you shouldn't use uk.ac.st_and.dcs.newsagent.agent, because 
  classes in that package are considered a core part of NewsAgent. You could just 
  use something like:</p>
<p class="codesnippet">package myagents;</p>
<p align="LEFT">The three import statements shown above tell the Java system to 
  import those three classes into the name space. The three imported classes and 
  the IListAgent interface define the way in which your agent communicates with 
  NewsAgent. </p>

<p align="LEFT">We have declared our new class as implementing the IListAgent

<pre align="LEFT" class="codesnippet"> public DemoListAgent() {

 }</pre>
<p align="LEFT">Constructing the agent simply consists of initialising its private 
  properties object. It is recommended that you initialise this to a new Properties 
  object even if your agent doesn't have any user configurable properties.</p>
<pre align="LEFT" class="codesnippet"> public String getName() {
   return m_name;
 }</pre>
<p align="LEFT">The getName() method should return the name of the agent. This 
  will be used in the Preferences dialogue to refer to the agent. It can contain 
  spaces, but shouldn't be too long (1-3 words).</p>
<pre align="LEFT" class="codesnippet"> public Icon getIcon() {
   return null;
 }</pre>
<p align="LEFT">The getIcon() method should return an icon associated with the 
  agent, or null. This method is currently unused in NewsAgent, so you should 
  probably just return null for now.</p>
<pre align="LEFT" class="codesnippet"> public String getDescription() {
   return m_desc;
 }</pre>
<p align="LEFT">The getDescription() method should return a longer description 
  of what the agent does. This is displayed in the description box in the preferences 
  dialogue when the agent is selected.</p>
<pre align="LEFT" class="codesnippet"> public JPanel getConfigurationPanel() {
   return new JPanel();
 }</pre>
<p align="LEFT">The getConfigurationPanel() method should return a JPanel object 
  (or a subclass of JPanel()) which will be displayed in a modal dialogue when 
  the user selects this agent in the preferences dialogue and clicks the Configure... 
  button. It is probably more useful to return a subclass of JPanel. A future 
  article will look at configuration panels for agents in more detail. If you 
  do not have a configuration dialog, return null from this method [Version 1.01B 
  or earlier: a bug in the agent system means that returning null from this function 
  will cause a NullPointerException when the user clicks on Configure... To get 
  round this problem, return new JPanel() from this method].</p>
<pre align="LEFT" class="codesnippet"> public void applyConfiguration(JPanel panConfig){
   ;
 }</pre>
<p align="LEFT">applyConfiguration() is called by NewsAgent when the user dismisses 
  your configuration panel by clicking OK in the modal dialogue in which it is 
  contained. The configuration panel is passed back as an argument to this method. 
  If you chose to use a subclass of JPanel, you can now cast panConfig to your 
  JPanel subclass and use any methods the subclass contains to determine how the 
  user changed the configuration in the panel.</p>
<pre align="LEFT" class="codesnippet"> public ListAgentMessage checkMessage(MessageHeader msgHead) {
   /*
    * If the message is from &quot;Brian&quot;, mark it in red.
    */
   String realName = msgHead.getRealName();
   if (realName.indexOf(&quot;Brian&quot;) &gt;= 0) {
     // Change the appearance of the message
     msgHead.setForeground(Color.red);
     return new ListAgentMessage(false, false, true, false, &quot;&quot;);
   } else
     return new ListAgentMessage(); // Nothing changed<br> }</pre>
<p align="LEFT">checkMessage() is arguably the most important component of a ListAgent. 
  This is where you are actually passed a MessageHeader object to consider. In 
  the above example, the getRealName() method of MessageHeader is used to determine 
  the real name of the person who sent the message. If the real name string contains 
  the substring &quot;Brian&quot;, the setForeground() method of MessageHeader 
  is used to change the formatting of the header so that it is displayed in red. 
</p>
<p align="LEFT">An object of type ListAgentMessage is returned from this method 
  depending on what it did to the message header. The default constructor (ListAgentMessage()) 
  indicates that nothing changed in the message header. The long form of the constructor 
  has the following arguments:</p>

<PRE class="codesnippet">   public ListAgentMessage(boolean didDelete, 
                           boolean didChange, 
                           boolean didChangeDisplay, 
                           boolean isUserMessage,

 }</pre>
<p align="LEFT">These two methods are the final component of the properties system 
  of agents. When NewsAgent is ready to save your agent's properties, it will 
  call the getProperties() method of your agent. Similarly, when your agent is 
  initialised, the AgentManager of NewsAgent will call the setProperties method 
  to restore the properties of your agent to the saved values.</p>
<h3 align="LEFT">Summary</h3>
<p align="LEFT">In describing the workings of the DemoListAgent, we've hopefully 
  provided you with the starting blocks to writing your own agents. Future articles 
  will go into more detail on some of the more intricate elements of agents, including 
  how to implement your properties panel.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The best way to learn about agents is to look at the source code 
  for agents provided with NewsAgent. The relevance agent is by far the most complex 
  agent provided with NewsAgent. It consists of several classes which you can 
  find in the dubh/agents/relevance subdirectory of the source distribution (available 
  in <a href="../../download.html">downloads</a>).</p>
