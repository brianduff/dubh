<h3>Am I Just Too Lazy?</h3>
<p>Ok, I have an admission to make. About seven or eight months ago, I was working 
  away on my senior honours computing project. Being somewhat bereft of a half 
  decent social life, I had the time (and patience) to pour inordinate amounts 
  of time into churning out code. The end result was NewsAgent 1.0. I noticed 
  a prominent gap on my web page (namely that there was nothing useful on it at 
  all), and on the spur of the moment uploaded NewsAgent. After lots of pretty 
  painful feedback, NewsAgent 1.0.1 was born. And I made lots of promises about 
  how things would improve during the summer holiday when I had &quot;lots of 
  free time&quot;. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, real life caught hold of me a little earlier than expected, 
  and before I knew what was happening, I was churning out inordinate amounts 
  of code for a UML modeling tool &amp; Java generator that Oracle will be releasing 
  this year, and to my delight, being paid handsomely for my efforts. Good stuff, 
  you might say, but what about poor wee NewsAgent, left neglected on drive D 
  of my PC for many months?</p>
<h3>Here's Where You Come In...</h3>
<p>Well, I'm still finding some time to work on NewsAgent, but things are a little 
  slower than the old days &lt;sigh&gt;. Don't lose hope, though... NewsAgent 
  was intended from the very start to be open source software, and has been released 
  under the GNU General Public License since version 1.0.1. The idea is that NewsAgent 
  is more likely to evolve into a useful program if it is a collaborative effort 
  between enthusiastic volunteers. That's the idea. And you, of course, could 
  well be a potential enthusiastic volunteer...</p>
<h3>ThingyMeBob.sqigglyWoo(&quot;I don't know what to do&quot;);</h3>
<p>You don't even need to be an ace Java programmer to help (one glance at the 
  source code will tell you this). In fact, you don't even need to program at 
  all. Maybe you have a flair for documentation, or would be willing to spend 
  a little time providing resource string translations for a non English language. 
  Whatever you want to help with, you can contribute, if it's useful, I'll integrate 
  it into the &quot;official&quot; version of NewsAgent, and fully credit you, 
  and of course you can distribute NewsAgent yourself (provided you follow the 
  license agreement). If you want to discuss some ideas, get in touch with me... 
  Email bduff@uk.oracle.com or telephone +44 1189 244901 ( 01189 244901 in the 
  UK). </p>
<h3>Inspiral Satsumas</h3>
<p>Here's some ideas on how you can contribute:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Write, improve or correct user documentation</li>
  <li>Improve the source code build environment</li>
  <li>Write an agent</li>
  <li>Write / rewrite / improve a major piece of functionality (e.g. networking 
    code, scripting support, email support, mime support)</li>
  <li>Translate a resource file to a foreign language</li>
  <li>Distribute NewsAgent from your web site</li>
  <li>Make a pop song about NewsAgent</li>
  <li>Pay for a tv advert</li>
</ul>
<p>Erm, ok ignore those last two... Get in touch!!!</p>
