-------  ----		-------
1.03.02	 28/12/96	Added about & options boxes. Allowed adjustable speed/sound

1.03.05   2/01/97	Added 'paddle' mouse cursor. Changed bounds checking
					algorithm (inblock? method. Still misbehaves, and doesn't 
					bounce naturally.)
					
1.04.01	  2/01/97	Added mouse clipping support. Added preference for mouse 
					clipping (in new "Control" preference dialogue subsection - 
					may want to make this a tabbed control later). Changed WinBlock 
					font on game form. Changed paddle sprite (still not quite finished). 
					Added selection of ball colours. Modified score calculation to take 
					into account ball speed. Added registry support for saving and loading 
					preferences & high score tables. Table is still not implemented. 

1.04.03	  INDEV		Shrunk ball down (too small, maybe), Changed ball/paddle bouncing so the
					ball bounces at angles other than 45 deg. [?/?/?].
					Changed joystick and speaker images in Options dialogue to icons rather
					than bitmaps, so the background is masked properly.
					Altered the about box so it uses the new DubhAboutBox ActiveX control.
					Changed all MS Sans Serif fonts to Tahoma, for "Office 97 Look".
