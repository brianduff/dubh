    <h1>Project Marco: Hosted Bookmarks Service</h1>
    
    <h2>Aims &amp; Objective</h2>
    
    <p>
      Many users today work from multiple sites (e.g. both
      home and work), or use multiple web browsers for different tasks. It
      can be cumbersome trying to keep these different sets of bookmarks
      in synch with each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such a problem lends itself well to a hosted solution. Rather than
      keeping bookmarks separately in each browser, bookmarks are stored
      on an internet server, and can be easily accessed and updated from
      any location with internet access.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the objective of project Marco is as follows:
    </p>
    
    <div align="center">
      <p class="boxout">
        To provide a hosted bookmarks service that can be used to access and
        maintain a list of bookmarks for multiple users over the internet.
      </p>
    </div>
    
    <h2>Background</h2>
    
    <p>
      As a "proof of concept", I've developed a single-user hosted bookmarks
      application, which I am currently using both at home and at work. This
      can be found 
      <a href="../../brian/bookmarks/showbookmarks.xsql?editmode=false">here</a>.
      It requires a modern browser (Mozilla 0.8 or Internet Explorer 5.5 will
      do nicely).
    </p>
    <p>
      It has the following features:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        HTML viewing mode, with collapsable categories
      </li>
      <li>
        HTML editing mode, with links for deleting and maintaining categories
        and bookmarks
      </li>
      <li>
        HTML forms for editing / creating bookmarks and categories. 
      </li>
      <li>
        Simple
        digest authentication to prevent unauthorized modifications.
      </li>
      <li>
        XML output for application interoperability.
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
      And uses the following technologies:
    </p>
   
    <ul>
      <li>
        mySQL 3.23.32 database
      </li>
      <li>
        Oracle XDK to produce XML from SQL and transform it to HTML using XSLT
      </li>
      <li>
        Jakarta Tomcat servlet engine
      </li>
      <li>
        W3C DOM level 2 and CSS level 2 for client niceties (form validation,
        collapsing categories etc.)
      </li>
    </ul>
