      <p>
        NewsAgent is a completely free Java USENET Newsreader. It was 
        written by Brian Duff and is currently in development as an
        open source project.

      <p>
        As well as being a fully featured News reader, the program also has
        support for Agents: plugin modules which can affect the way messages
        are processed when reading or posting news articles.

        I finally gave in to temptation and am now renting a fast dedicated
        server from <a href="http://www.uk2net.com">UK2</a> (big kudos to this
        company, they provide a fantastic service at an unbeatable price). I've 
        also registered the domain names dubh.org and dubh.co.uk. Please change 
        any bookmarks for this site to point at:

        Which is our new, permanent home!

        The site is being rewritten from the ground up, so things may be a bit
        shaky for a while.
