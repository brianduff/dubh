      <p>
        NewsAgent is released under an <a href="http://www.opensource.org">
        Open Source</a> licence. This means that the source code for
        NewsAgent is available for anyone to read, and copy for their own
        use. You may well ask the question, "Why?". Rather than answer this
        myself, I'll just lazily refer you to <a href="http://www.opensource.org">
        OpenSource.org</a> and <a href="http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr">Eric Raymond</a>'s
        paper <i><a href="http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/">
        "The Cathedral And The Bazaar"</a></i>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Suffice to say, the hope is that by making NewsAgent a collaborative
        effort, it will evolve into a much more useful application.

  <section id="whatshappening" name="What's Happening With NewsAgent Development?">
    <html>
      <p>
        There hasn't been a full release of NewsAgent for about 2 years now,
        so you may well ask the question, "is NewsAgent dead?". If truth be told,
        I'm extremely short of free time, and also the type of person who gets
        continually distracted by new things. I rarely seem to finish free-time
        projects like NewsAgent, parly because I'm lazy and partly because I get
        bored easily and want to play with new stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even worse, my views on the purpose of Java are starting to shift a little.
        When NewsAgent was first released, I was certain that Java was made for
        application development. While I think this may still be the case, it has
        rapidly developed as a server side language, and I'm beginning to realise
        that this is the direction Java, if not application development in general,
        is going. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The net result of this is, nothing changes. NewsAgent still might be developed,
        if I get sufficiently interested in it again or suddenly develop huge amounts
        of free time. But I'm not making any promises.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's not all doom &amp; gloom, though. As long as I am capable, I'll
        continue to provide active support for development of NewsAgent, hosting
        this web site and the CVS repository. So if anyone out there wants to develop
        NewsAgent further, rest assured I'll help out in any way I can.

        NewsAgent relies on a couple of other projects to work. These are both
        also hosted on this site. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The back end interaction with an NNTP server (or any other provider) is
        enabled by JavaMail and the <a href="../../dmp/index.xml">Dubh Mail
        Providers</a>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        A number of UI services and tools are utilized from the 
        <a href="../../dju/index.xml">Dubh Java Utilities</a>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        NewsAgent is one of several projects integrated into a nightly build
        automation process on the Dubh.Org server. This process is driven
        using the Apache Jakarta <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/ant/index.html">
        Ant project</a> and the 
        <a href="../../buildtools/index.xml">Dubh Dev Tools</a>.
