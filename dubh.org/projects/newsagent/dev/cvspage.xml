      <p>
        CVS (Concurrent Version System) is a Software Configuration Management
        (SCM) tool. It provides a repository for files and folders, and is
        capable of storing several different versions of files. SCM is very
        important when several people are developing a project at the same time,
        since it is possible to concurrently work on files and merge them into
        the repository. More information on CVS can be found at
