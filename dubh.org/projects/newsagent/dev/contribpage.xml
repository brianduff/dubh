    <html>
      <p>
        The easiest way to become a contributor is to checkout
        the source code from the <a href="cvs.xml">CVS
        Repository</a>, do some work and send the patches in. If
        you are interested in continuing to help, you can get
        write access to CVS which will make it easier to help.
      </p>
      <p>
        You probably also want to sign up to the contributor
        <a href="mail.xml">Mailing List</a>, which is also where
        patches should be sent. If you want to help, but are unsure
        where to start, the mailing list is a good place to ask
        questions and make suggestions.

      <h3>Code Style</h3>
      <p>
        I'm not overwhelmingly fussy about coding styles (I get
        enough of that sort of thing at work). Also, NewsAgent's
        source is shockingly inconsistent in things like brace
        positioning. Just follow "common sense" guidelines, like
        using comments sensibly, not using hard tab characters
        and using UNIX eol characters.
      </p>
      <h3>Build Before You Check In</h3>
      <p>
        Before checking in code, <b>make sure it builds</b>.
        Information on building NewsAgent and other Dubh
        projects can be found in the 
        <a href="\projects\buildtools\index.xml">DevTools</a>
        project.
      </p>
      <h3>Keep In Touch!</h3>
      <p>
        Use the mailing lists and frequently let us all know
        what you're up to. This makes it easier for everyone to
        help out and avoid stepping on each others toes.

        I'm still looking for a servlet based bug database to
        use for Dubh.Org. If you have any suggestions, please
        <a href="mailto:brian@dubh.org">mail me</a>.
