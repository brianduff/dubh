    <html>
      <p>
        Contains javadoc for NewsAgent. This is useful for developers. Like
        me, for instance. The API documentation here is for the latest release
        version of NewsAgent. Javadoc for NewsAgent is generated nightly by
        the build process and can be found in the development section.

        Er. There doesn't appear to be a great deal of this at the moment :)
        There is some crappy old stuff from back when I was a student.
