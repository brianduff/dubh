<p><a name="_Toc404054990"><font size="4" face="Arial"><b>Project
Objectives</b></font></a></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The Internet is a global network
of computer networks. A number of applications of Internet
technology are possible, and many services, such as e-mail and
the world wide web, are popular with thousands of users across
the world.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">One popular Internet service is
&quot;Network News&quot;, otherwise known as USENET. This service
is potentially available to any user with an Internet connection.
Network news supports a large number of discussion groups in
specific categories. Users can post messages to groups or ranges
of groups, and can read messages posted to the groups. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Unfortunately, the usefulness of
Network News is greatly reduced by a number of important
problems, which make it difficult or impossible to retrieve
information that is useful and relevant from the vast amount of
text posted to Newsservers daily.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The aim of this project is to
provide a newsreader that can deal sensibly with some or all of
these problems, in order to make reading news more efficient and
productive for the user.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The final program will aim to
provide similar functionality to existing newsreaders, but to
contain &quot;intelligent&quot; features, which are capable of
detecting and avoiding some of the most common problems.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The most important aspect of the
project will be to implement a number of &quot;agents&quot;,
which are responsible for pre- and post- processing messages in
newsgroups. Examples of agents are conversation thread
summarisers, relevance detection and content type checking. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The use of agents will ideally be
easily extensible, it would be of great benefit if agents could
be 'slotted' in and out of the software as required.</font></p>

<p align="right"><a name="_Toc404054991"><font size="4"
face="Arial Black"><b>Context Survey</b></font></a></p>

<p><a name="_Toc404054992"><font size="4" face="Arial"><b>Background</b></font></a></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Introduction</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">We now provide a more detailed
look at the way in which Network News works, and detail some of
the terminology that is commonly used in network news software.
We also outline the main perceived reasons why the usefulness of
News is diminished. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Each user requires a
&quot;Newsreader&quot;, which acts as the client side of an
Internet protocol (TCP/IP) connection. Another piece of software,
the News server (or Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP) host)
is responsible for gathering together messages and communicating
with both newsreader clients and other NNTP hosts.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Arial"><img

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Figure 1&#150;
NNTP Clients &amp; Servers</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Problems with Network News</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Since the advent of the WWW, the
Internet has become hugely popular, with users in the millions.
Due to the naturally chaotic nature of USENET in general, and
it&#146;s popularity in particular, it is becoming increasingly
impossible for users to cope with the massive numbers of messages
passing through their local news server every day. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">A number of major problems are
apparent. We attempt to identify some of the most crucial
problems here.</font></p>

<ul>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial"><i>Spamming</i> is the act of
        posting numerous identical or similar messages to one or
        more newsgroups. These messages are often for advertising
        purposes or are otherwise not related to the topic of the
        relevant newsgroup. Firms or individuals who sell e-mail
        lists to advertisers commonly provide another source of
        spamming. Often newsgroup messages are used as a rich
        source of e-mail addresses for such firms, and this can
        prove to be irritating to regular Internet News users.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial"><i>Cross posting</i> allows
        any user to post messages to numerous newsgroups at the
        same time. It is considered a feature when used properly,
        but is often misused. In particular, an unintelligent
        news client program may fail to warn the user that a
        message they are replying to is cross-posted to a large
        number of groups. In addition, messages are often
        cross-posted to completely irrelevant groups in order to
        spread their coverage by advertisers. It would be useful
        to be able to determine how relevant a potential message
        to a newsgroup was before sending it to numerous
        newsgroups.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Large messages pose a problem
        for users connected to the Internet using a modem. Some
        newsreaders will automatically load articles in a
        newsgroup when the user changes to that newsgroup. This
        wastes time and therefore money. If the newsreader does
        not have adequate &#145;off-line&#146; capabilities, the
        user can be connected to their Internet Service Provider
        (ISP) while reading news, thus paying for the phone call,
        but not putting the connection to use. This is wasteful
        both for the user, and for the ISP. Users sending binary
        files to groups that are not designed to handle them
        compound these problems.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial">While many newsreaders will
        arrange articles in such a way that the units of
        discussion (threads) are clearly visible, threads can
        often fragment and become difficult to follow. If a user
        posts a question on a given day, then returns a few days
        later to check if their message has been responded to,
        most newsreaders provide no quick way of determining if
        this is the case. While most allow you to search for text
        in the message headers, it would be useful to be informed
        of replies to one&#146;s postings without having to
        search all the headers in a newsgroup manually.
        Additionally, it is often difficult to get a complete
        overview of a thread of discussion from a single message.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial">The user&#146;s connection
        depends entirely on the server he/she is connected to. If
        the server is slow, or goes down, the user may no longer
        be able to read news. In this event, the user might
        circumvent the problem by connecting to a different
        server. In some newsreader software, it is only possible
        to change news servers by restarting or otherwise
        globally reconfiguring the software.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial"><i>Message Expiry</i>: Each
        message on USENET has a specific &quot;time to
        live&quot;. The message will eventually expire. Some news
        servers are so slow that by the time they receive a
        message, it has very nearly expired. </font></li>
</ul>

<dir>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial">These problems reduce the
        usefulness of USENET, as they prevent users from keeping
        track of messages they are interested in and following
        discussions within groups (known as threads) they are
        involved with.</font></li>
</dir>

<p><a name="_Toc404054993"><font size="4" face="Arial"><b>Network
News Transfer Protocol (NNTP)</b></font></a></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Since the solution must be capable
of &quot;talking&quot; to existing news software, we will look
briefly at the technology involved in communication between
newsreaders and servers, and between new servers and other news
servers.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">[KL86] details the Network News
Transfer Protocol, and how it interacts with a news client. NNTP
normally works on a TCP/IP (Transmission control protocol /
Internet Protocol) network, which provides a reliable connection
based network interface.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Central to NNTP is the concept of
commands and responses. Commands are sent to the server by a
client, who when receives a (period-delimited) coded response.
Responses can be <i>status responses</i> or <i>textual responses</i>.
Text responses are always preceded by a status response, and
normally contain message text or a list of data. Status responses
are preceded by a numerical code, which uniquely defines the type
of message. A string that fully details the response follows
this. Table 1 summarises the main NNTP commands and table 2
explains the possible response classes.</font></p>

<p><a name="_Toc404054994"><font size="4" face="Arial"><b>Information
Systems Research</b></font></a></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">A large number of papers have been
written which tackle the problems of information retrieval and
relevance determination. Many of these could be of relevance to
this project. This section contains a brief review of some of
this research.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">[Man97] provides an interesting
and straightforward text compression scheme, which is
specifically designed so that compressed text can be searched
directly with little overhead. The compression technique attempts
to find pairs of characters that are common in a piece of text.
It constructs a weighted graph where the vertices correspond to
unique characters in some text, and the edges correspond to
adjacent pairs of characters. The algorithm attempts to partition
the graph into two subgraphs V<sub>1</sub> and V<sub>2</sub>, in
such a way that the sum of weights of edges from V<sub>1</sub> to
V<sub>2</sub> is maximised. It turns out that this problem is
NP-Complete, but the graphs are generally not large (since the
size of the graph is determined by the number of unique
characters, rather than the size of the text). The algorithm
suggested effectively chooses a random starting configuration and
tests each vertex to see which subgraph provides a better
'score'.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">[KPC95] looks at a method of
summarising documents. This will probably be of use in
summarising long news articles, particularly FAQs and other
high-content postings. In this way, the news program will be able
to allow the user to decide how relevant an article is, based on
the summary of that article. Additionally, a summary of a thread
conversation could be generating using the method suggested in
this paper.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">[Sed88] provides some suggestions
for string searching algorithms, which will undoubtedly play an
important part in the implementation. </font></p>

<p><a name="_Toc404054995"><font size="4" face="Arial"><b>Existing
Newsreader Software</b></font></a></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Trn</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Trn is descended from the original
newsreader, and has been around from long before the Internet's
popularity surged. Figure 2 shows a message being displayed in
Trn.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Arial"><img
src="Image3.gif" width="459" height="225"></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Figure 2 &#150;
Trn displaying a message</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Trn is a very old program, and is
lacking in all of the features considered desirable by the
problem definition. It has the added disadvantage of being
exceedingly slow, and the user interface is unintuitive and
non-friendly.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Additionally, the program only
runs under UNIX.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>PINE</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">PINE is a popular UNIX
e-mail-reading program. In newer versions of the program, it is
possible to browse newsgroups as if they were e-mail folders.
Figure 3 is a screenshot from PINE, viewing a newsgroup listing.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">PINE's biggest advantage is its
familiarity. Many UNIX users are accustomed to using PINE for
e-mail reading, and can therefore learn to use the newsreader
very rapidly. The combination of a newsreader and e-mail client
seems to be a good design decision.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">PINE is, unfortunately, lacking
many of the features mentioned in the problem definition. On one
hand, this means it is uncluttered and easy to use. On the other
hand, it means that many of the problems mentioned above will
come into play if PINE is used for news reading.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Arial"><img
src="Image4.gif" width="459" height="225"></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Figure 3 &#150;
PINE displaying a message list</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">One noticeable omission from the
PINE newsreader is the lack of visual threading. This can be seen
in the screenshot. In many newsreaders, it would be possible to
see a hierarchical view of messages, and reply postings to those
messages. These tree-like structures make message threads easier
to follow. PINE just puts all the messages at the
&quot;toplevel&quot;.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Microsoft Outlook Express</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Outlook Express is included with
Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0, and provides an electronic mail
and newsreader in the same application. Figure 4 shows a
screenshot of Outlook Express browsing some newsgroups. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Again, the integration of news
reading and electronic mail works very well in Outlook Express.
The newsreader contains a solid number of features, some of which
answer the problems in the problem definition of this project.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Some of the features in Outlook
Express' Newsreader include:</font></p>

<ul>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial"><i>Newsgroup Filters</i> -
        similar concept to kill files: ensure that messages
        containing some specified text are never displayed to the
        user. This is useful for filtering out 'spam' and junk
        mail.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial"><i>Newsgroup Keyword
        Searching</i> - when selecting newsgroups to subscribe
        to, Outlook Express lets you perform keyword searches,
        which means it is easier to find relevant and interesting
        newsgroups.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial"><i>Thread Filtering /
        Collapsing</i> - threads can be collapsed (so that only
        the first message in a thread is visible) and expanded
        again, and entire threads can be ignored. This means that
        it is easier to find posts that are relevant or
        interesting.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial"><i>Offline Reading </i>-
        messages threads or entire newsgroups can be downloaded
        and then browsed offline. This is a bonus to people who
        have an internet connection using a phone line and an ISP
        (Internet Service Provider)</font></li>
</ul>

<p><a name="_Toc404054999"><font size="4" face="Arial"><b>Conceptual
Model</b></font></a></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Newsgroup</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">From a user's point of view, a
newsgroup is a collection of message threads. A number of
newsgroups can be available from the server, and the user can
subscribe to a subset of the available groups.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Thread</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">A thread is a unit of conversation
within a newsgroup. Normally, threads consist of a tree-like
structure containing message headers, and replies as their
descendants. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Message</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">A message consists of a header and
a body. The header contains a number of fields, some of which are
normally of interest to the user (From:, Subject:), and some
which are not so interesting (Path: and References:, for
instance). The body contains the actual text of the message.
Often this is plain text, but it can also be MIME-encoded or
UUEncoded binary data. A message may also contain <i>quoted text</i>,
a common practice of including text from a previous message in
the reply.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Folder</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">A folder is a user-defined storage
repository for messages. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Agent</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The solution will provide a number
of &quot;agents&quot;, which are responsible for processing
messages or groups of messages before / after the user reads
them. Some examples of agents are:</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><i>Relevance Agent</i> -
responsible for determining the 'relevance' of an article posted
to a newsgroup (for incoming messages). Also responsible for
checking the relevance of outgoing messages, and warning the user
about posts which are of low relevance.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><i>Content Type Agent - </i>determines
whether outgoing messages are of an acceptable content type for a
given newsgroup. Particularly, this agent will warn the user
about posting binary encoded messages to non-binary newsgroups.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><i>Netiquette Agent - </i>responsible
for detecting common netiquette problems in outgoing messages.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><i>Message Terminator -</i> kills
incoming messages depending on user specified criteria.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><i>Message Marker</i> - (similar
to the terminator), tags messages depending on user criteria.
Tagged messages headers are presented in some way that stands out
more to the user (e.g. in bold, or in differing colours).</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><i>Outside Hours Agent </i>-
downloads messages as they become available from the newsserver
directly, when the user is not using the computer (or perhaps
reading a message). This helps to combat the problem of premature
message expiry, by making sure that items of interest to the user
are cached locally before the server has a chance to expire them.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><i>Digester - </i>responsible for
organising a thread of messages into a &quot;report&quot;,
consisting of an entire conversation. A colour, symbol, or some
other method could indicate each participant of the thread in the
digest report. </font></p>

<p><a name="_Toc404055000"><font size="4" face="Arial"><b>Functional
Requirements</b></font></a></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Message Browsing Requirements</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The key browsing requirement is to
provide a user interface capable of displaying messages in a
sensible and clear manner. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Newsgroups are hierarchical, so it
makes sense to provide newsgroup information in a tree-like
control. Each node on the control will include a small icon
indicating whether it is a leaf. Leaves typically correspond to
&quot;real&quot; newsgroups. An example of such a hierarchy is
shown in figure 5.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Arial"><img
src="Image6.gif" width="236" height="246"></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Figure 5 &#150;
Newsgroup Hierarchy</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">When a newsgroup or a folder is
selected, a message list should become available. This message
list will contain the articles in the newsgroup or folder,
arranged into a hierarchy of postings and responses to those
posts. This is a useful visual threading technique, and is
highlighted in figure 6, a screenshot from Microsoft Outlook.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The message list will also contain
status information on each message, such as whether it has been
read, and it's relevance score. One agent might be responsible
for tagging messages which are of special interest or relevance
to the user, and this would also be displayed as status
information.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Arial"><img
src="Image7.gif" width="452" height="220"></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Figure 6 &#150;
Message List</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The third message-browsing
component is the actual message viewer. This should consist of a
scrollable area containing the message body and a fixed area
containing the (relevant) message headers. It should be possible
to get details of the full message headers if required, but this
should not be forced on the reader (again, to minimise irrelevant
information).</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Quoted text inside the message
body should be displayed in a different colour or style (e.g.
italic), in order to distinguish it.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">An important functional aspect of
the message browsing subsystem should the use of context menus.
These menus are activated in a system dependent way, for example
right clicking under UNIX and Windows, or holding down a certain
key and clicking under MacOS. Context menus provide functions
that are relevant to the currently selected item. A context menu
for a message header in the message list, for instance, should
allow the user to respond to the message, or to obtain a summary
of the message. A context menu over a newsgroup might allow the
user to unsubscribe from the group, or access more information
about the content of the group. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Message Composition
Requirements</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The message composer should
consist of a straightforward text-editing window. It should also
provide facilities for quoting sections of a message that is
being responded to. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Agent Requirements</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">There are two types of agents:
reading agents and composition agents. Reading agents are
responsible for processing messages retrieved from the news
server that were written by other news users. Composition agents
are active during message composition or just before a newly
composed message is submitted to the news server.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The primary job of most reading
agents is to ensure that messages deemed to be of the highest
relevance in a group are tagged in such a way that the relative
relevance is clear to the user. To this end, some messages may be
automatically hidden if they match certain criteria.
Nevertheless, such effects must not be permanent: the reading
agent is not allowed to completely prevent the user from reading
any messages retrieved from the server. A sensible way to meet
this requirement is to give the user the option of permanently or
temporarily disabling agents.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Special classes of reading agents
aren't actually visible to the user. Relevance checking depends
heavily on statistical information. To this end, some reading
agents are responsible for cataloguing statistical information
about the types of posts commonly found in newsgroups. In this
way, the relevance agent remains dynamic.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Composition agents will attempt to
make sure that a post being composed by the user is relevant to
the group, and doesn't breach common netiquette problems. Some of
these checks are best performed while the message is actually
being composed. In this case, a (non-obtrusive) warning should be
displayed with specific information. Other composition agents are
more effective when the message is complete, and is ready to be
submitted to the news server.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Offline / Out of hours
Requirements</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">A key requirement is that the
newsreader should work well in offline environments. This is
substantially distinct from the requirement that the software
should function &quot;outside hours&quot; in order to keep up to
date with news articles, since the user inevitably has no control
during this process. There must therefore be a trade-off between
the two: offline features are more useful for people utilising a
modem connection to the Internet and out of hours features are
better suited to direct (and preferably non-expensive) permanent
connections.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The simplest way of providing
offline facilities is to have a global on/off toggle. When the
software is put into offline mode (either by the user or
automatically depending on some user specified criteria), no part
of the code is allowed to make any network connections until the
state is toggled. Messages and message headers will be cached by
the software while the user is doing other things (e.g. reading
an article), while the software is in online mode. Because of
this, the user can continue to read messages while in the offline
mode. However, when an uncached article is encountered, the
software is entitled to ask the user whether he/she wants to go
online in order to retrieve the article. Naturally, the user
should be able to disable such prompting.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Out of hours operation will
probably make more sense as a separate application, or by
invoking the standard application with alternative command line
options, since a GUI serves no useful purpose. It's
responsibility will be to permanently connect to the server and
cache any articles until it reaches a predetermined disk space
maximum. It will also perform statistical analysis of newsgroup
articles in order to keep the relevance detection agent up to
date.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Digesting / Reporting
Requirements</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">If an article is particularly
long, it will not be shown to the user directly. Instead a
summary of the article will be displayed, which the user will
have the option of expanding into the full document. The precise
&quot;cut-off&quot; length will be determined by experimentation
once the summarising features of the software can be fully
tested.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The user will have the option of
displaying thread digests. These digests will outline the
&quot;conversation&quot; represented by an article thread. This
will probably be implemented by representing each party by a
distinct symbol, colour or other font feature. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Other Requirements</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">There should be as many different
ways of performing a task as possible. To this end the user
interface will consist of menus, toolbars, key combinations and
context menus. It is particularly important that menus are well
designed &#150; each menu title should indicate a specific object
in the user interface and contain operations on that object.
Standard menus (File, Edit, View and Help) should also be
provided.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The toolbar should consist of the
most commonly invoked menu functions.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">A status bar at the bottom of the
window will provide general status or help information as well as
highlight non-intrusive warnings. ToolTips (helpful text which
pops up close to the mouse pointer when it lingers over a
control) will be used on most non-obvious controls.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">For neatness, as few windows will
be used as possible. Most message browsing should be centred on
one window. There will be three distinct 'panes', corresponding
to the three main browsing requirements highlighted above
(newsgroup list, message list and message view). The size of
these panes should be adjustable by the user. A separate window
should be used for message composition. Message summarising might
use a third window. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">An example user interface is shown
in figure 7. This was generated as a prototype in Borland
JBuilder.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Arial"><img
src="Image8.gif" width="402" height="288"></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Figure 7 &#150;
User Interface Prototype</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Intrusive error or warning
messages should be kept to an absolute minimum. Such messages
should be modal and require the user to respond sensibly before
continuing.</font></p>

<p><a name="_Toc404055001"><font size="4" face="Arial"><b>Non-functional
Requirements</b></font></a></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>System Requirements</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Since the Internet is widely used
by users with a variety of operating systems, platform
independence is an important aspect of Internet based software.
It can be assumed that relatively modern systems are being used
(for instance Windows 95 on a Pentium, or Solaris on a SPARC).</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">It is also assumed that the end
user will have some form of direct Internet access, either
through a local area network connection, or using a SLIP or PPP
modem with a service provider. For this reason, it is also safe
to assume that the user has some form of web browsing software
(see documentation requirements).</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Another reasonable assumption is
that it is possible for work to be carried out when the user is
not using their machine. This is reasonable in most systems.
UNIX, for instance, provides &quot;Cron&quot; for carrying out
tasks at scheduled times. Alternatively, processes can be run in
the background, and the user can log out. Under other platforms,
it is necessary to run an application and leave the machine
switched on.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Performance Requirements</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The minimum system requirements
depend on the platform. For Windows 95 systems, the following
system requirements are reasonable:</font></p>

<p><a name="_Toc404055003"><font size="4" face="Arial"><b>Choice
of Implementation Language</b></font></a></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">A language supporting multitasking
would be useful for this software to implement some of the
features. In addition, good networking support should be
provided, preferably with support for common Internet functions
built in. Since the problem is clearly object based (messages,
newsgroups, connections, folders, files, windows etc. all fit in
well to an object model), a language providing object oriented
facilities would be of benefit to ensure clean design and
extensibility.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Ideally, the code should be
portable, since computers with a multitude of operating systems
are used on the Internet.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>C++</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">C++ provides object orientation,
and is suitably versatile to meet the requirements. It is also a
fast language; most C and C++ compilers produce machine language
as efficient or more efficient than a human could produce. It
doesn&#146;t however provide key features such as multitasking
support, networking or user interface utilities. These features
are commonly specific to the operating system, which makes the
code non-portable across platforms.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">In addition, the object-oriented
features of C++ are far too easily circumnavigated, meaning that
it is easy to slip into messy, non-portable implementation.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Another major disadvantage of C++
is that it does not provide easy string manipulation
intrinsically. From the problem specification, it is clear that
the solution will require a fair amount of string processing.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Tcl</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Tcl is a scripting language. The
language has the advantage of code level portability across
almost all UNIX platforms, Windows 95 and MacOS. Tcl provides
intrinsic networking and user interface facilities. Newer
versions of Tcl are compiled (rather than interpreted) into
bytecodes by a Just In Time (JIT) compiler which executes at
runtime, offering large performance benefits over a plain
scripting language. Tcl has excellent string manipulation
facilities (in fact the string is the only data type in Tcl).</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Tcl does not provide intrinsic
object oriented support, although libraries are available to
allow the user to mimic object oriented code. This is
particularly transparent, however, and can easily be avoided
leading to some of the same problems as C++. In addition, Tcl
doesn&#146;t provide any multitasking support, short of running
another program within a currently running program, and
communicating with the other program using strings. This level of
multitasking would probably not be effective for this design.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Visual Basic</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Visual Basic is a simple language,
based on the flexible BASIC language. Previous versions compiled
code to bytecodes that were then interpreted by the Visual Basic
runtime module. Newer versions provide the option of compiling to
native code, offering large performance gains. In addition,
critical components can be written in a fast language (C or
Pascal, for instance) and dynamically linked to Visual Basic
programs. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Visual Basic provides some
object-oriented features; again the programmer must exercise
control. Where Visual Basic really excels is in user interface
design, and the range of pre-existing components available. These
&quot;ActiveX&quot; or OLE (object linking and embedding)
controls can be created in Visual Basic and used in VB, Visual
C++, Delphi and many other languages under windows. The controls
are object oriented, and ideal for code reuse and sharing. Visual
Basic ships with controls for Internet access and even has a
specific NNTP control. Of note is Visual Basic&#146;s string
support, which is reasonably flexible.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Visual Basic fails again in the
area of multitasking: it provides no support (other than
launching a separate program) of multitasking unless large
portions of the program are written in C or C++. More
importantly, programs written in current versions of Visual Basic
will only run under 32 bit versions of Windows (i.e. Windows 95
and NT). A version for the Macintosh is planned, but will not be
available in time for this project. UNIX is completely
unsupported, with no plans to support it in the future. Since a
substantial number of Internet users use UNIX, this is an
important point to consider.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Java</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Java is an object-oriented
language, which has been described as &quot;C++ with all the
nasty stuff removed&quot; [REF]. &#145;Nasty stuff&#146; refers
to pointers and a number of other C++ features that allow the
programmer to circumvent the object oriented model and easily
cause major errors and bugs.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Java is compiled using the Java
compiler (</font><font size="2" face="Courier New">javac</font><font
size="2" face="Arial">) into Java byte codes. It is then executed
by the Java runtime (</font><font size="2" face="Courier New">java</font><font
size="2" face="Arial">). The main advantage of this approach is
portability. Java bytecodes compiled on one system can be
executed by the Java runtime on any other system for which it is
available. At the moment, this extends to almost all of the major
UNIX platforms, Windows 3.1, Windows 95 and NT, OS/2 and MacOS.
Using bytecodes inevitably means it is slower than native code:
Sun estimate it is approximately 75% as fast as native code on
most platforms.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">In addition to being highly object
oriented, Java is designed to be a networking language, and
particularly an Internet language. It is a modern language,
although has been well tested and a number of &quot;real&quot;
applications have been written using it. It also supports
threads, which is one approach to multitasking. As with all
features of Java, thread support is operating system independent,
provided the OS provides multitasking support of some description
(almost all do).</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Java also provides a native String
class, making string manipulation reasonably straightforward. It
also provides intrinsic support for graphical user interfaces
using the Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT).</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">In addition, newer versions of
Java have support for components similar to that employed in
Visual Basic (JavaBeans) and intrinsic database support using
Java Data Base Classes (JDBC). This database support might prove
to be useful in this product.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Conclusion</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">While any of these languages could
potentially be used for implementing the project, it is clear
that Java contains more of the required features than any other
implementation language. Specifically, a number of IDE
(integrated development environments) systems for constructing
Java applications have been released in the last few months. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">In particular, Borland's JBuilder
provides a usable IDE, which allows the programmer to more easily
construct visual elements of and application. In this way,
programming is made more efficient, as the (sometimes copious
amounts of) code required for constructing a user interface is
generated automatically, and the programmer can concentrate on
the more important parts of the code [Man97]. </font></p>

<p><a name="_Toc404055004"><font size="4" face="Arial"><b>Software
Engineering Summary</b></font></a></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">An important goal is to make the
software maintainable, and easy to improve and extend. To this
end, a consistent software engineering policy will be adopted in
the implementation. This policy is summarised here.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Programming Standards &amp;
Conventions</b></font></p>

<ul>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial"><i>Variable Names</i> will
        follow common Java &amp; C++ conventions. Ordinary
        variables will be in lower case. Multiple words can be
        used for simple variables, in which case the first word
        will have a lower case first letter, and remaining words
        will be capitalised (e.g. </font><font size="2"
        face="Courier New">myVariableName</font><font size="2"
        face="Arial">). Class names will consist of joined
        together words describing the class, with the first
        letter of each word capitalised (e.g. </font><font
        size="2" face="Courier New">MyClass</font><font size="2"
        face="Arial">). Constants (static final member variables
        in Java) will be in uppercase with underscore characters
        separating words if necessary (e.g. </font><font size="2"
        face="Courier New">MY_CONSTANT</font><font size="2"
        face="Arial">).</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial"><i>Comments</i> will use the
        Sun recommended javadoc format. This involves preceeding
        each member function and class with a descriptive
        comment, outlining it's parameters and return value if it
        is a method. This has the added advantage that
        documentation can be automatically produced from the
        source code using a software program supplied with the
        Java Development Kit. Short comments will be used to
        explain non-obvious sections of code. Generally,
        implementation specific comments will be included <i>inside</i>
        a member definition, while design specific ones will be
        included <i>before</i> the relevant member.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial"><i>Files</i> will be arranged
        in the standard Java way: the code for each class will be
        contained in a separate file, and entire modular units
        (called packages) will be included in separate
        subdirectories.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial"><i>Program Flow: </i>a
        consistent program layout will be used in all source
        files.</font></li>
</ul>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Testing Arrangements</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">As each class is implemented, it
will generally be tested using a test harness or with internal
debugging code. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Build versions of the program will
be tested at regular intervals, to ensure that newly added
modules don&#146;t break the application.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">A thorough testing procedure will
be conducted when the project is complete.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Dealing with Problems &amp;
Checking Progress</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The project monitoring sheet
included in this report has a number of checkpoints. At each of
these checkpoints, a certain set of features should have been
completed. If this is not the case, the project will be
considered to be behind deadline, and more time will be allocated
to it to catch up.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Should problems arise, they will
be dealt with in an appropriate manner, as early as possible.
Problems which might threaten the deadlines of the project, and
which are not central to the solution may be abandoned in the
interest of completing the project. Each large problem will be
noted in the project log, and the solution detailed.</font></p>

<p><a name="_Toc404055005"><font size="4" face="Arial"><b>Software
Design</b></font></a></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Overview</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">This section will detail some of
the basic classes and methods involved in the implementation of
the project. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Time has been allotted on the
project monitoring sheet for refining this design further and
providing a more detailed class design.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Project Packages</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Java code is normally divided into
a set of distinct packages, which contain a number of classes.
The three packages are highlighted in the table below. The
packages have been named following Sun's recommended package
naming conventions.</font></p>
