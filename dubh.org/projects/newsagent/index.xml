    <h2>What is NewsAgent?</h2>
    <p>
      NewsAgent is a completely free Java USENET Newsreader. It was 
      written by Brian Duff and is currently in development as an
      open source project.
    </p>

    </p>
    <p>
      As well as being a fully featured News reader, the program also has
      support for Agents: plugin modules which can affect the way messages
      are processed when reading or posting news articles.

    <h2>NewsAgent Developement Terminated [03 June 2001]</h2>
      <p>
        As of this month, I'm no longer actively developing NewsAgent.
        The source code for NewsAgent will remain on the dubh.org cvs
        repository for the forseeable future.
      </p>
      <p>
        Instead, I'm switching my development effort to the Mozilla
        <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/grendel">Grendel</a>
        project. Grendel aims to be a Java mail/news client, and is 
        already far more fully featured than NewsAgent ever was.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you have comments or queries about NewsAgent, you should
        post them to the Grendel Development forum on 
        <a href="http://talk.dubh.org">talk.dubh.org</a>.
