    <h2>About JFreeCiv</h2>
  
    <p>
      JFreeCiv is a Java clone of <a href="http://www.freeciv.org">FreeCiv</a>,
      an open source version of the immensely popular strategy game 
      <a href="http://www.apolyton.net">Civilization</a>.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Development History</h2>
    
    <p>
      The freeciv java port was originally developed by Artur Abies, I spent a
      furious couple of weeks hacking the source to attempt to upgrade it to 
      support Freeciv 1.10.0 about a year ago, which resulted in rewriting
      various parts of the client and networking code. It has never been in
      an entirely playable state.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Current Status</h2>
    
    <p>
      Currently (July 2001), I'm working on updating the client to support the
      forthcoming 1.12.0 release of Freeciv. I've basically got back to where
      I was with 1.10.0 but can now connect to a server compiled from a recent
      CVS snapshot of 1.11.7-devel.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      If you want to see what I've been working on recently, as well as an 
      overview of the current status, have a look at the 
      <a href="http://cvs.dubh.org/JCVSlet/log/jfreeciv/jfreeciv/Changelog.txt/0">
      Changelog</a>.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Downloads</h2>
    
    <p>
      A binary distribution of JFreeCiv is not yet available. A source code
      snapshot is available on request, but the preferred method of getting
      the code is to check it out from cvs. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The code is in the jfreeciv module on the dubh.org cvs server. Details
      on accessing and downloading the code is available from 
      <a href="http://cvs.dubh.org">http://cvs.dubh.org</a>.

    <h2>New Screenshot! [28 Oct 2001]</h2>
    
    <p>
      This new screenshot shows the major changes to the MainWindow as well
      as the flag support in the nation dialog. The
      screenshot was taken using Java 1.4 pre-beta 3 in the Windows Look 
      and Feel under Windows XP with the "Olive Green" color scheme.
