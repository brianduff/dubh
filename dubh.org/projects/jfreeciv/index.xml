		<h2>About JFreeCiv</h2>
	
		<p>
			JFreeCiv is a Java clone of <a href="http://www.freeciv.org">FreeCiv</a>,
			an open source version of the immensely popular strategy game 
			<a href="http://www.apolyton.net">Civilization</a>.
		</p>
		
		<h2>Development History</h2>
		
		<p>
			The freeciv java port was originally developed by Artur Abies, I spent a
			furious couple of weeks hacking the source to attempt to upgrade it to 
			support Freeciv 1.10.0 about a year ago, which resulted in rewriting
			various parts of the client and networking code. It has never been in
			an entirely playable state.
		</p>
		
		<h2>Current Status</h2>
		
		<p>
			As I said, it's not playable yet. I'd like to find more time to work on
			it, but I've too many other projects on the go at the moment. One day...
			Anyway, the code is in the dubh.org <a href="http://cvs.dubh.org">CVS
			Repository</a>. You can also download a 
			<a href="http://balveda.dubh.org/freeciv-20010626.tar.gz">
			source code snapshot</a> [gzipped	tarball, 1.14MB]. I haven't tried to
			build this for several months, so I've no idea what state it's in.
