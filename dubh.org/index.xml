        <i>
        "From there Elisha went up to Bethel. As he was walking along the road, some 
        youths came out of the town and jeered at him. "Go on up, you baldhead!" 
        they said. "Go on up, you baldhead!" He turned around, looked at them and 
        called down a curse on them in the name of the LORD. Then two bears came 
        out of the woods and mauled forty-two of the youths."</i> [2 Kings 2:23-24]
