<title>Boring Self-Gratifying Crap</title>
<h1> Boring Self Gratifying Crap </h1>
<p>Hi, I'm Brian. This is a boring, self-gratifying page about me with some pictures 
  taken with my latest toy (digital camera) bought in a vague attempt to distract 
  myself from my otherwise dull and monotonous existence... </p>
<p>This is me:</p>
<p><img src="brian.jpg" width="300" height="244"></p>
<p>Notice the baldness, lack of dress sense and the lovely frosted-glass living 
  room door in my rented Reading flat. Notice also the adventurous beige walls. 
  Naturally beige is my favourite colour, having lived in flats and student residences 
  with beige walls for the last eighT GODDAM YEARS !!! ;)</p>
<p>This is where I spend a lot of time being a sad git (and that's just away from 
  work...):</p>

<p>(the dazed looking lassie in the seat is my sister Lesley on her &quot;vacation&quot; 
  - i.e. using my internet connection to chat up strange men who are pretending 
  to be women and yabbering stuff about ASL whatever the hell that is)</p>
