This is all stuff I wrote either in my final year at University in 1997/8 or in the subsequent few years after graduating up to 2002 or thereabouts. It was imported from a CVS repository backup I've been keeping around in Google Drive for many years which I just recently figured out how to import into github via cvs2svn and svn2git.

It's all horribly outdated, but some of the more ahem... interesting bits... are probably:

* JFreeCiv: a Java port of the open-source Freeciv game (clone of Civilization)
* na: NewsAgent, my senior year project at University of St. Andrews: a USENET reader with smarts.
* WinBlock: A small arkanoid style game I wrote to learn C# / .net when it first came out.
* dju: A variety of utilities for Java, mostly focussed on UI coding. As with everything here, grossly outdated.

I thought I'd share this on github for no particular reason other than the fact that it's a nice place to keep it beyond my backup :D
